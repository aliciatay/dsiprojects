### About my repo and I 

>"...whoever controls data controls the world..."

Besides the desire for world domination, I was an integrated marketer who wanted to dig out much more knowledge that was hiding within the mounds of data. So I got my hands dirty and learn the dark arts of Data Science.

This repo stores my first steps into the deep rabbit hole of Machine Learning, where I aim to complete all 5 core projects organized by General Assembly Singapore.

## Project 1:  EDA on America's Examinations (ACT & SAT)

Researched on a foreign subject (America's Examination system for two examinations - ACT and SAT) to justified recommendations on increasing student uptake year-on-year.

Highlights:
* Did data wrangling and cleaning
* Performed statistical inferences to clarify data assumptions 
* Created various graphs through APIs such as choropleths via the Plotly library
* Supplemented data with independent sourcing of news on the societal and political changes in America

_Note: Project was issued via a Question- and- Answer format where there was a specific sequence for me to follow_
 
### Project 2: Price Prediction

Given the popular Ames Housing dataset, I had to predict house prices, with the extra challenge of using only classical linear regression models and utilizing only 30 features.

Highlights:
* Data wrangling with various features of high/missing null values
* Feature Elimination with Lasso and Ridge Models
* Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV


### Project 3: NLP Classification of Mental Illnesses

Took a challenge to build a model to classify two mental illnesses well-known for being consequential to each other: Suicide and Depression.

I was personally motivated given the rise in suicidal declarations through social media channels and livestreams. 

Highlights:
* Webscrapped Reddit threads r/SuicidalWatch and r/Depression
* Teased insights through EDA of 1-gram/2-gram and WordCloud visualizations
* NLP techniques such as TF-IDF/CountVec
* Tested on various models such as Multi Naive Bayes, Log Regression and Extra Trees
* Built a model that was 68% accurate in F1 score
