# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

## Problem Statement

*****Background:*****

* Standardized testing is an important part of the college application process for many students looking to enter their desired undergraduate university. 
* Test scores are used as indicators of academic ability and potential, alongside scholarship eligibility.
* The SAT and ACT tests are two kinds of standardized tests offered in the US.

**Objective of Study:**

* By analyzing test scores and participation rates from SAT and ACT tests taken in 2017 and 2018, we aim to make recommendations to the SAT College Board on ways to increase SAT participation rate in Alaska.

##Key Takeaways:

1.States who tend to achieve the lowest/highest score for a type of test, maintains the trend to 2018.
- Minnesota continued to achieve the highest for SAT 2017 and 2018
- Nevada continued to achieve the lowest for ACT 2017 and 2018
- District of Columbia continued to achieve the lowest for SAT 2017 and 2018


2.Specific to the ACT test only, states who achieved the lowest composite score are among the highest participating states

- ACT 2017: Nevada
- ACT 2018: Nevada and South Carolina

3.States who participate in ACT test and perform well, have lesser reason to switch to SAT as trends show that they might not be able to maintain high performance in the other test

##General Recommendations:

1.Increase/Maintain high participation rate from high participating states

Here are some ways:
* College Board can strike more partnerships with online education academies to give free review lessons and tests to better prepare students for SAT tests, and give confidence in scoring well.
* Similar to Florida, free "SAT" days of state-funded/school-funded tests on weekdays can be implemented

2. Work with states that has low participation rates in both ACT and SAT, to advocate SAT global recognition 

*There might be more states like Alaska that implements state-specific entrance tests. College Board can strike partnerships with colleges (both local and overseas) with such high-schools to exemplify the broad connection and recognition of SAT tests.

## Case Study: Alaska (State of Choice)
* Introduce a SAT Free Day, with partnerships with online academy courses
* Stir ambition to enter more prestigious colleges in USA, outside of Alaska. Advocate SAT participation as a way into these colleges

More information for this will help to frame our understanding 
1. Student's perception on SAT vs PEAK <br>(feedback on perception and differences between the two tests)
2. Alaska's socio-economic status <br>(Economy of state, lack of variety in jobs offered within the state might limit a student ambition to take further education tests)
3. Median household income in Alaska <br>(Cost of exam could be a barrier)
