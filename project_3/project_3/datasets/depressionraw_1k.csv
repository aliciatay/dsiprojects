###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,1,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2321,53,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2321,,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1572389522.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Last therapy session I was explaining to my psychologist about my 'inner Child' (an expression which I hate but it made sense at the time). I described how it felt like she was trapped in a stone room with one high window which she can look out and hear other kids playing outside. She wants to leave the room but she knows it's safe in there and that makes her frightened to leave.

,depression,"I’ve felt this way for a while now, yesterday I spent a good portion of the day wondering if I was going to kill myself how would I do it, when, what preparations to take. I came to the realisation I’m 99.9% sure I don’t want to kill myself, and wouldn’t want to inflict that on my loved ones. I just find no joy in anything anymore and the thought of making long term plans exhausts me because I just find waking up every morning to be bland and void of all meaning.

I’d like someone to comment saying they feel the same and I’m not a freak or exaggerating, though I’m not sure what it will achieve.

I just find no joy in anything anymore and the thought of making long term plans exhausts me because I just find waking up every morning to be bland and void of all meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"IM TRANSSSS!!! That feels SO good to say!!

Over the past six months my depression and anxiety got worse because I literally had no SO. I had like 5 crushes in that time and not one panned out, and that really got to me. I became really desperate, I even asked out a girl that I didn’t know well at all (and promptly got rejected). It was really getting to me, for some reason I had this horrible urge to find someone and date them. And when I really couldn’t it started affecting relationships with some people. I was so self conscious, I hated my body, voice, face, everything about me I saw myself as having no quality of life.

Flash forward to about 2 weeks ago when I was fucking around and tried on a dress for the first time. I felt this weird wave of happiness, warm soothing comfort, like a hot knife through butter. It was my first ever sense of euphoria. 

And then on a 12 hour car ride to NY five days ago toward the end I started panicking because I realized I didn’t want to be masculine, and I said out loud to myself “am I trans?” And I’m so glad I asked that question.

Don’t get me wrong I’m still self conscious about my body and dysphoric but knowing it will all change soon into something I feel safe as makes me so so happy. Tonight I’m coming out to my sisters and next week hopefully, my parents.

So in honor of this all let me introduce myself:

I spoke up about my mental health issues months ago and lost my job. Technically I quit on good terms because they stood me down and weren't paying me and I was never gonna be allowed to come back.

No manager will provide a reference for and I don't have enough people to provide enough character references. I will never find a job. I get rejected for shelf stocking, cleaner, car washer. I am very good in IT, studying &amp; earning qualifications recently. But they mean nothing. Everything wants years of experience. I never hear back for anything. Been months now. 

My quality of life will only go down. There is no ""It will get better."" I mean how ?? How the fuck can it get better ? I have no chance. Who the fuck would take on someone with no references regardless of there qualifications ?

So no job, no future there. Which means no partner in life either. Who wants an ugly, depressed, unemployed loser who cant even get a job at the bottom ?

My life can't get better no matter how hard I try, so how is wanting to end it a bad thing ? OH life is sacred or think about the people you'll be hurting by leaving. Who ? No one is here now when it counts ? They are only there after because minimum commitment is needed. Turn up to a funeral, do a facebook post. The end.

It is not worth me living this life of loneliness and pain. This constant state of fail, try again, fail, try again, fail. I am sick of picking myself back up. What's it all for anyway ? I am so far behind in life I could never own a home, chance a family decreasing, and having a retirement plan would be giving up on everything else at this point and just wageslaving myself to death if i even got a job.

Being alive for life's sake and for others this just wrong for me. How dare they think I should have to be alive when the future is so bleak for my existence. Oh but don't worry they can pat themselves on the back for ""Being there""

If the future is hopeless I shouldn't have to put up with a crappy life no matter how hard I try.

I would turn in occasional assignments, but skip a lot too. I don’t usually do this. I’ve missed assignment before but not this much. 

I’m at the point where if I think about what I have to do I will just start crying and go lie in bed. I feel like I already gave up on school but if I do, I’ll postpone my graduation by a whole year.

,depression,"I've lost my motivation for life. I don't care about much. I go through the motions every day, just so I can make money to live on my own, as I don't want to be around anyone else. I don't like my job. It's so taxing putting on the happy face for 9 hours a day every day and then having to pretend again on the weekends so friends and family don't notice. 

I'm on meds, they only do so much. They help me get out of bed and make it easier to slap that smile on my face. Doesn't help much else. 

I've been in therapy but there's nothing a therapist can do when I have no motivation to get better or try anymore. 

I don't care about self-care. I shower 1 or 2 times a week only so that I don't smell bad next to my coworkers who would have to suffer. Dishes pile up for weeks or months. Clothes all over the floors. Don't really clean except maybe 1 time a month or so. 

I have no passion for anything. I have no motivation to try anything. Why bother. Nothing gets better. I've tried for years. It only gets worse and worse. 

Every time I find out something else about myself, it's worse than before. I'm tired of digging for answers, especially when there are none. 

I don't care about self-care. Why bother. Don't want to be around friends, cancel all plans with them. I don't feel better walking for 5 minutes or going to the gym or whatever the fuck. I did that for YEARS and it was nice, but now I just don't fucking care. 

Maybe if I had a passion in life things would be different. But I don't. And I make good money with the job I have so I don't see a point in trying something else. 

I don't care about myself because I'm essentially a bad person. I do bad things to people and I'm selfish. It adds up. I've hurt people I'm close to. I'm not very bright either and that depresses me too. Maybe it shouldn't, but it does. 

I know I have it way better than so many people and I am grateful for that, but I feel worse because I don't fully appreciate what I have. More selfishness. 

I used to care about shit. For the past several months now I've just quit. I fell back on my eating disorder, self-isolation, self-hatred back in full, and I just see how useless in the world I am and how meaningless my life is. 

I watch everyone else go on with their lives, my friends and colleagues, and I stay stuck in the mud just watching them swim away. 

My motivation is gone and I don't care about getting better because nothing ever does get better. I tried so hard and nothing good came of it. Only worse things. I don't see a point in trying again. Or doing anything. Laying around and going through the motions is pretty much my life.

I am 20 years old, go to college in NYC, am a Korean citizen, have lived in Seoul, Hong Kong, Boston, Ithaca, and NYC, spending about half a decade in each city. I have attended about 6 schools in my life. I have a hunch that I am a bad friend.

I wonder where I can start. I guess it's important to say that on the outside I appear normal. I'm a little bookish and a little slow to understand jokes. But, it's nothing out of the ordinary. I speak a little formally but I try not to be pretentious. I have gotten comments that people love my genuine character. People have said that I am a good listener and ask great questions.

Yet, I am left with no one to immediately turn to when I am in my worst moments. I have depression and have suffered from suicidal thoughts in the past. I, at first, create intense friendships that slowly fizzle out between 6-12 months. I never feel like people come to me in moments of crisis when I find myself having to turn to people for support and advice in moments of difficulty. I feel my friends rarely reach out to me to connect or call. It is almost always me doing this. I have always hated partying and big social gatherings. Never really been invited to them.

I have  a history of responding very very slowly to texts that I do not understand why I do but I'm trying to figure it out. I have for the past few months tried very hard to respond to texts as soon as possible and not simp on plans.

Today someone of my apathy seemed to fade and I was in a rather okay mood and planned on being productive today. 

I went to school and listened to the lectures and somehow understood parts of them. I finished more work than usual. 

When I got home I had a meeting with my therapist on zoom, I went and cashed my check, and at around 5:30 I took a shower. I can only shower every other day because my skin gets EXTREMELY dry very easily after a shower so it’s important I don’t do it too much. I also am out of hair conditioner so my hair was going to be a little dry too and not that smooth when it dried but whatever. 

After I got out of the warm shower all the thing I did that day wore me out and I was pretty tired but I was still in a productive mood and so I still planned on finishing my room and getting some homework done (a very difficult thing for me to try and do especially computer work) but I was exhausted so I decided to take a short nap, but my mom called me down an said she wanted me to wash all the silverware. So I went down stairs and did that deciding to finish my nap on the the couch.

Well when I next open my eyes there was much more people in the living room then when I closed them which immediately stressed me out (I’m an introvert with social anxiety and I’ve never seen two of these people before) and I hear the air decompress from the whipped cream can. I look up and see my brother holding a can of whipped cream and my aunt taking pictures (I hate when people take pictures of me I feel physically ill and she knows this. 

I touch up by my hairline and my fingers comb through the greasy, sticky whipped cream in my still wet hair. They all laugh at me and I just laid there and just turned off. I felt so embarrassed, and angry, and disgusted at the stuff in my hair. I thought about how I’ll probably have to jump in the shower again which will dry out my hair and skin even more. 

Even though it was a harmless prank my fight or flight kicked in and I ended up having a panic attack went up to my room and cried. I’m still crying. I’ve lost all that rare motivation I seemed to have had today and now I’m emotionally exhausted and ready to just go to sleep for real in my dirty room homework incomplete. 

I know it seems so stupid to get so messed up other this but it’s always the smallest things that can take away those few good moments I seem to get between my anxiety and depression.

I want to die. I am desperate for any relief at all from this depression, and I know from experience that nothing works. Therapy was long and expensive, the meds fucked me up with their side effects and wrecked my metabolism... and a disastrous course of ECT erased years of my memory and has disrupted my ability to properly form memories ever since.

But killing myself is not an option. I have people who depend on me, and as much as I hate myself I can't bear to think of the harm I could cause from committing suicide. The only solace I can find anymore is through helping others. I found that as long as I made other people better I could endure.

Except now I've become a role model to thousands of people. Close friends and people who I have never met before tell me how I inspire them.

To those that have been around me for a while I am the one who &amp;quot;beat suicidal depression&amp;quot; and became successful. Because of my advocacy for my fellow queer employees at work I have somehow become a figure head in my international company of over 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t tell anyone in real life what a mess I am. I can&amp;#39;t tell them how I&amp;#39;ve started to self harm again. I can&amp;#39;t go back to the hospital with the mental health holds and the lack of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so alone&lt;/p&gt;

I graduated in June 2019, I started working at Burger King before I graduated so I would have something to do afterwards. It was shit conditions, so much stress and  not getting payed well, but it was at least a job. I managed to find another job at a call centre as tech support for one of the biggest TV companies in Sweden. This job was also shit but better than Burger King. But I didn't want to go to work, I would go to the toilet and wish for the time to go faster. Customers would call us idiots, yell at us and call us all the names in the book. On top of that we had a lot of pressure from our boss. No call should be longer than 10 minutes, during that time you hade to register the ticket while talking to the customer and we had to sell them things aswell. No matter how well we did we could always do better. Once again I have a new job which is amazing. But I feel like the stress from this and last year is taking its toll on me. I haven't been unemployed since I left school and I haven't had more than 3 days off at the same time (besides some weekends) and I'm losing my mind. 

I want to quit, I feel like I cant live anymore. Sometimes I cry between calls I take because I feel so overwhelmed. I have an amazing boyfriend but he doesn't really know how bad it is. My mom knows me but she doesn't either really know how bad I feel. I try to stay strong for them but I don't know for how much longer I can do that. I have a doctor I go too and a psychologist. I told the doctor that i often forget words, cant sleep properly, have lots of anxiety and slur on words quite often. So far we've taken like 5 blod samples but nothing really sticks out. 

I'm tired of feeling like shit, I'm trying to get help but it doesn't feel like its going anywhere. My boyfriend doesn't really understand but he does his best which I appreciate. I don't want to talk about it too much either, I don't want it to come off as complaining and annoying. 

I feel like if I quit my job for a month or two, maybe that's enough time for my body and mind to rest so I can start working again or study. Or I work now and save money so I can study much sooner. I don't know what to do, I dont want to let anyone down but I feel like I'm at my breaking point.

,depression,"So, I've been struggling with my depressive emotions/thoughts for the majority of my life (29M); but besides from having my ""Lows"" a couple months out of almost every year, I've managed to at least stay afloat by keeping myself distracted by staying busy with work, school, hobbies, or other obligations. This worked for me until I had my first breakdown.

I was going through a particularly deep low around the time it happened, and I was wrapping up a busy day at work when, like a jolt of electricity, it hit me. It's like I heard a ""snap"" and I just fell to the floor on my knees, slumped over staring blankly at the floor tiles, unblinking.  I then heard a voice in my head that didn't even sound like me and it simply said, ""There's no point"", and just like that EVERYTHING lost its meaning, the world around me stood still and colors de-saturated to a dull gray. 

The small part of me that was still able to think logically went into a panic, my heart racing, my breathing shallow and quick. I tried to pull it together and stand up at least before someone sees me and it causes a scene. ""There's no point"" said the voice again and it was then I realized my legs had stopped working. No matter how hard I tried,  I couldn't convince myself there was any point in getting up from the floor.

 Life no longer had any shred of meaning..or purpose. I was stuck there..

Every reason I tried to give myself to get up and keep going, the voice would just say again, ""there is no point"" and my legs would simply tremble uselessly in place at my attempts to stand. It wasn't until the sound of someone slamming a door nearby that suddenly shook me out of this seemingly endless loop and I finally managed to get to my feet. Sweaty and shaken, I clock out for the day and rush home.

A little over a year later, I've never been quite the same since that day, knowing at any moment I can lose control over my own body to whatever that voice was and to what other things that voice can make me do or believe. I've since lost passion in every hobby that I once had, lost the drive to maintain friendships, lost the heart to love anybody or myself. Its all dead now and I've been reduced to something that can barely manage day to day routines, little things can send me into mood swings, and I can't reciprocate feelings properly. The worst thing being I know the way I am now has turned away people who actually and genuinely cared about me. 

For those of you who know folks like me and show us compassion, I thank you so much. Sorry we don't always seem on the outside to really appreciate you as much as we really do, we just have trouble even accepting the fact that there are people out there who care about us more than we care about ourselves and we don't know how to properly show you how much you mean to us.

But I can't man. It's not a non issue. I have a seriously difficult time just coping with the way life is. I have a really difficult time not having any expectations for life. I have a really difficult time not feeling like I deserve a decent life not filled with struggle. I just have trouble accepting that fact. That life is inherently full of struggles. I find it so hard to cope with that. I'm not built to take on challenges with confidence. I'm not built to be disciplined and to work on goals. 

I know that makes me a lesser man, but at this point I don't think I will ever make myself a person worthy of respect..I'm just a whining child...except I guess I'm only privately so. On the internet. But still. This is all I think about every day. This is my outlook on the world and life

. I just can't change that. I can't change that. I can't change that because at the heart of it all: *I cannot accept life merely for what it IS and nothing more.*

That's just the truth of it. You can ask me why. You can ask me what do I expect. And I don't have an answer.

 I'm just too afraid to let go of my escapism and to actually start trying to live. Trying to improve. It just feels like I'm completely leaving *any and all* security I have in life by being an actual adult and going it on my own.

And again, I feel like such a child. I legitimately feel distraught over the fact that I might actually have to learn some things and actually *choose to do productive things"" and completely forgo doing stupid immature shit like replaying the same old videogames or smoking weed. And I know that the end goals are supposed to make that worth it, and I know the videogames have no value, but idk. It's like I keep running to whatever makes me feel the safest and I just plug my brain into that after work and in all my free time. 

Fuck man. I really need to grow up, but it's so damn hard. Everything just feels too hard. I. So fucking stubborn. If you told me to break shit down into smaller steps I would have a HUGE amount of psychological as well as emotional pushback again at that idea fucking *automatically*.

&lt;p&gt;I know that makes me a lesser man, but at this point I don&amp;#39;t think I will ever make myself a person worthy of respect..I&amp;#39;m just a whining child...except I guess I&amp;#39;m only privately so. On the internet. But still. This is all I think about every day. This is my outlook on the world and life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. I just can&amp;#39;t change that. I can&amp;#39;t change that. I can&amp;#39;t change that because at the heart of it all: &lt;em&gt;I cannot accept life merely for what it IS and nothing more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just the truth of it. You can ask me why. You can ask me what do I expect. And I don&amp;#39;t have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just too afraid to let go of my escapism and to actually start trying to live. Trying to improve. It just feels like I&amp;#39;m completely leaving &lt;em&gt;any and all&lt;/em&gt; security I have in life by being an actual adult and going it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, I feel like such a child. I legitimately feel distraught over the fact that I might actually have to learn some things and actually *choose to do productive things&amp;quot; and completely forgo doing stupid immature shit like replaying the same old videogames or smoking weed. And I know that the end goals are supposed to make that worth it, and I know the videogames have no value, but idk. It&amp;#39;s like I keep running to whatever makes me feel the safest and I just plug my brain into that after work and in all my free time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck man. I really need to grow up, but it&amp;#39;s so damn hard. Everything just feels too hard. I. So fucking stubborn. If you told me to break shit down into smaller steps I would have a HUGE amount of psychological as well as emotional pushback again at that idea fucking &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt;. And I know that about myself and if fucking sucks, because it means as I am right now, I am literally incapable of feeling emotionally well and good just by doing the things that would improve my life, my self, my health, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Every choice you've ever made, every fleeting moment of happiness or regrettable moment of recklessness or even bout of depression can be influenced by what you take in.

Live in a place with too much lead? That can make you have bipolar-like symptoms and change your personality to be more reckless and violent.

Live in a place with to much CO2? Maybe that's why you've been sad for so long.

,depression,"This is probably against the rules, I don’t know. I’m just tired. I’ve suffered from depression for most of not all of my life I can remember. At the very least the last 23 years. The earliest I definitely knew what I was feeling was 10 years old. I’ve considered killing myself ever since then. I’ve pretended that wasn’t something I was focusing on. I’ve pretended I wasn’t going to do it and that I wasn’t better off dead. But in the end, I’m tired of lying to myself and now thanks to another redditor I’ve realized it’s truly better if I am dead. There are 2 people in this world that I think love me. One is my wife, but I don’t know how, I constantly do things that drive a wedge in between us but somehow she hasn’t left me. The other person is actually my newborn daughter. She’s too young to even recognize what live is but I like to imagine it’s there. But both of them would be better off without me. 

My entire I’ve driven everyone away from me while claiming to want them in my life. But that was a lie. I didn’t want to be in my own life let alone have others close enough to see what a giant shit I am. I’ve screwed up every chance to improve my life. I don’t know if it was intentional or not anymore but I definitely fucked it up. Everytime something started going right, I’d do something to make everything worse within a matter of weeks if any measure of success. My wife and I get married, I draw a wedge that results in our sex life dwindling and her viewing it as a burden. Then I’d complain which would amplify how miserable she was about it. My best friend and I on better terms than ever, I have an emotional affair with his wife and convince her to post nude vids and photos on Reddit. He finds out and I haven’t heard from him in what will be 5 years February. My wife barely forgives me but only because she saw the text where his wife approached me and she felt guilty about our lack of sex and I never physically cheated. 

So for the past 5 years I know I ruined two lives and caused my wife to have her own issues to work through. I’ve abused her emotionally because of my depression and yet she’s never given up on me. That’s a mistake. I took out my self hatred on her by starting random arguments over nothing. I’ve treated her far worse than she deserves but somehow she refuses to leave me. I’ve tried leaving her but she always looks too hurt and I can’t leave her with her still loving me even if I know it’s best for her. Until now. 

We have a newborn daughter. She’s amazing and yet I have a hard time caring for more than the necessities that keep her alive. I view my responsibilities as her being alive the next day but nothing about caring for her. I want to love her, but I don’t feel connected to her. Most days I convince myself that my wife must have cheated and that she’s not really mine but the baby literally looks just like me. There’s no denying it. 

Up until a couple hours ago, my plan was to keep living. 
I was going to slowly wedge myself further away from my wife till she’s with me out if obligation and the love is gone but not so far as she doesn’t respect me. I was planning on being in my daughters life till she has memories of me that she could look back on fondly and I was going to hope I would develop the connection enough she’d at least be confident her dad loved her more than anything true or not. I’m terrified that at a certain point I’m going to drive her away and one day she’ll realize what a failure and how ashamed she is of me and I don’t want that to happen but I’m too toxic for it to be any other way. 

I was planning on 5 or 6 years from now to kill myself. I was going to set my wife up with no debt, and then kill myself in a way that looked like an accident so she would get the maximum possible payout from health insurance. That way if she kept working it was by choice not by necessity and she’d have the time to be a single mom while finding someone else to give her what she deserves that I’ll never be able to do. 

That was the plan. But today I chose to blow off steam and get into fights with strangers on Reddit. It’s something I do once every couple months when I feel stressed and like I’ll do something stupid. During one of these fights there was an extended thread with a redditor who has a PhD in psychology I think is what he said. He made me realize I might be a repressed pedophile. At least that what his professional opinion. I don’t know if he’s 100% true of not but, I can’t take that risk. I can’t take the risk of my daughter ever being harmed in that way. I’d rather her have no memories of me and just stories told by her mom rather than memories of me potentially harming her. I don’t feel like a pedophile, I don’t have sexual urges towards children but this psychologist made a convincing argument that it’s something in my unconscious mind waiting to come out and that my unconscious mind could just wake up one day with that on the surface. Even if there’s a 5% chance that somewhere deep I don’t even know is lurking us a pedophile, it’s too big of a risk to take. 

I’ve already taken steps to log out of this profile everywhere that matters. this will be the closest thing to a suicide note I leave. I’ve logged out of my account on everything but my phone. I’m going to smash it as soon as I post this so my wife nor anyone can trace this account back to me. I’ve even deleted the email address linked to this account as it was one no one knew I used anyways. I’m going to the garage, I’m going to grab my wife’s car and write a note saying I’m heading to the store to get a few things and taking her car because I’m almost out of gas and don’t want to take the time to fill up. Then I’m going to drive her car out to the main road and run a red light at a 3 way intersection that is used mostly by speeding semis no seatbelt no side airbags and head out the window. If I don’t get T-boned and die on impact, I’ll hop the curb opposite the intersection and bury the car in the lake drowning myself. Either way, I fully expect my wife to wake up to police knocking at the door. Distraught, in pain but better off for if. 

I won’t have had enough time to finish paying off her student loans like I planned, but she won’t have to work any more than part time at her current job she loves after the insurance money. In time she’ll realize her life is better without me. Hopefully my daughter will grow up with my wife telling her good stories and happy tales. Hopefully she’ll get that Christmas present I hid in my car for her and it’ll be something she hangs on to and has fond thoughts thinking her dad was actually someone she deserved to call daddy. Either way, I won’t feel this way anymore and my daughter will never know what a disappointment I would have been. 

For too long I’ve hated every minute of my existence. The happiest times of my life always precede me causing pain to someone else in someway. All the milestones are marked with regret. All the achievements aren’t about successes I earned but about barely not failing. The best thing that can be said about me at work is I never did anything to get fired from this most recent job. The best thing that can be said about my education is I had plans to finish my college degree and was only one semester away. The best thing that can be said about my marriage is he didn’t get divorced even though the only time they had sex in 5 years was solely to have a kid. The best thing that can be said about me as a son or brother is, even though my family hated my life decisions and the things I supported and spent the bare minimum amount of time with me as possible, I hadn’t gone so far to be disowned yet. 

I’ve hated so much in my life. I’ve hated my father, I’ve hated my heritage, I’ve hated my religion, I’ve hated my jobs, I’ve hated the things I was actually good at and talented with, but most severely I’ve hated myself. I’m done hating. The only way to stop is to get rid of what I hate most. If that means I die, I die. At least when I’m dead it won’t matter to me anymore. Shit, even if there turns out to be a hell and I’m tortured forever, at least I’ll be able to accept it since as long as I’m alive I always know there’ll be a chance the pain and depression will be over and there’s a potential for peace of nothingness. 

Goodbye. If somehow you read this and see my profile and know who I am in real life, don’t share this with my family or anyone. Let them hold on to the lies I told and what I pretended to be.

I might as well post this on r/rockbottom but I feel like it fits better here. 
To start off with a few disclaimers: first pff, English is not my first language, so please don't mind any spelling, grammar or language errors. Secondly, barely anyone knows about most incidents you are about to read, and I really do feel like you won't understand me and my feelings without me painting the whole picture. 

Anyway, to the story of my life we go.
It all began on a certain day at the end if spring when I was five years old. Back at the time I used to live in Japan with my three years older brother and two years younger sister and my parents, of course. A friend of mine atp the time had a sleepover birthday party. It was a lot of fun until the next day when I returned home. During my time gone a fire had started in my house and my family was sent to the hospital. To cut the story short; no one of them had survived the fire.
On short notice I moved in with a friend at the time and quickly after I was sent to my uncle, where I currently still live. My new ""dad"" and his wife had a daughter so I somewhat felt at home. She is older than me but not that that really matters to me.
Skip to 2019. I've built up my life quite well with the help of a few friends but mostly good therapy. I've had a reallyweird relationship with a girl, as in we were childhood friends that became distant lovers, but we sometimes broke up just to come back together again a few weeks later.
In August 2019 my girlfriend, that girl I just mentioned, got diagnosed with cancer a second time. The first time was when she was way younger and the doctors had thought to have eradicated the tumors but somehow they managed to grow back and even stronger and quicker. After fighting for her life and a few surgeries she lost the second fight to cancer. I've never really had the chance to say goodbye to her but I don't really want to go too deep into that as that's been mostly dealt with already. Now go to a year later. My granddad (both my actual dad's and my ""dad""'s father) is about to die. I don't really know how to use this word in English so I'll just say it here, not in a sentence: euthanasia. Now hear comes the weird part: he is the only ""real"" family i still have, but yet I can't cry about it how I usually would, or I can't even feel anything about it. When I think about his death I just get numb in a way of emotionless. Then I start doubting myself whether or not this is normal, and if I'm being respectful to him and my new family.

I've really lost myself here and I need guidance from people on what to think and do. I feel like I can't really talk to a therapist anymore without hating myself or being embarrassed by myself. That why I reach out to you, so I can hide behind this screen without anyone of you knowing me. I at least feel safe. At least feel safe.

,depression,"One fine day , on the 8th of October this year , I was standing in the ward near the entrance getting scolded by my a senior. He didn't take his eyes off me and kept on ranting about this and that and repeatedly threatened to not allow me to get through my internship. The matter here though was that , that morning I had come earlier than he had taught and did all the work assigned to me and was about to do the rest when he saw me going towards the ward and he taught am a brat and I am purposely being late. On the other hand , my co-worker came very late and didn't do a bit of work and yet it was me who was getting scolded rampantly while he stood behind him so that he is not seen and thus not scolded. With all the attention and wrath funnelled onto me and my co-worker getting away with it, I was slowing growing impatient while my senior continued scolding me, up until a point of threshold was reached ...since he didn't give me a chance to explain. I screamed my lungs out at him , saying he doesn't understand the situation and pointing to my hiding co worker I asked him whether he even knew at what time he came. And after that I heard him shout at me ""get out"" but that didn't stop me because that was expected and my heart was pumping with rage and despair at the same time and I cried and screamed back at him until they left and before they left I told them that I am sick in my head to which my senior said ""so u agree that u are a mental idiot"" , and he left with everyone following him , leaving me alone , even my coworker who rather seemed to be rejoicing over the way I was being scolded since he didn't even speak up to say how he never showed up at time. 
There I was , standing at the entrance weeping my heart out, like my world had ended, like my career had ended and like no one understood my mental ailment. 
The love and care that I got was from the most unexpected ones - the security ladies - they offered help and comfort , made me sit down in a chair and offered some coffee. They showed me compassion at the lowest point of my life. The point wherein I openly showed the world that I was screaming inside. 
The patients on the beds were amazed at the scenario and at my weeping and the nurses didn't give a damn about it because of fear of him and I guess that's totally understandable since anyone who took my side at this point risked being scolded unjustly by him and what more-  their jobs. 
I had mentioned this earlier in a post on another group and now I post this again - The people in authority don't always use their position for good or for your growth , some use it for oppression because if I remember the way I was treated , it seemed as though he wanted me to cry, he wanted me to break down and I did and then what..? They left me, and he called me a mental idiot. 
Is that what my depression was? Having been taking pills for almost 2 years, having tried atleast 5 different pills and undergoing a treatment called rTMS therapy which couldn't be completed because of my academics. Having attempted suicides. And survived through them all, is that the value of mental health? 
Don't people understand until they feel it? The immense loneliness, the hollowness , the void , the numbness that's painful enough to crush you , so much so that it presses u down to your bed every morning so that u don't face the day, that u dont go through it?

,depression,"I’m depressed, I know exactly why I’m depressed, and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it for years to come. I feel like I’m being forced to grow up, like I haven’t had time to be a kid. I’m 17, and from when I got into grade school all I really did was work on school. Once I got into high school everyone told me I needed a job, an idea for a career, I plan for life. And I did that, but then I changed and it fell apart. I’m back at square one, realizing that I wasted all of my time. All I want is to grow up. I feel like everyone my age is childish, whether that be because I grew up too fast or maybe I’m just wrong and an asshole. Either way, I just want to feel like the people I’m surrounded with understand me, but no one truly understands me. There was one person, but she’s gone now. Basically all I can do is wait until I can move out. That’s years away. Years without any sort of pleasure, since nothing makes me happy or excited anymore. I smile at jokes that don’t amuse me, like my body is trying to give a reaction because I’m supposed to react, but I hate that I’m giving off fake reactions to everything. Every time I smile I want to break my neck. But hey, I’m just a kid. And everyone will look down on me because I’m a kid, someone with no life experience and “doesn’t know real depression”. Through all the therapists and psychiatrists I’ve been through, nothing has helped.

I feel like I’m being forced to grow up, like I haven’t had time to be a kid. I’m 17, and from when I got into grade school all I really did was work on school. Once I got into high school everyone told me I needed a job, an idea for a career, I plan for life. And I did that, but then I changed and it fell apart. I’m back at square one, realizing that I wasted all of my time. All I want is to grow up. I feel like everyone my age is childish, whether that be because I grew up too fast or maybe I’m just wrong and an asshole. Either way, I just want to feel like the people I’m surrounded with understand me, but no one truly understands me. There was one person, but she’s gone now. Basically all I can do is wait until I can move out. That’s years away. Years without any sort of pleasure, since nothing makes me happy or excited anymore. I smile at jokes that don’t amuse me, like my body is trying to give a reaction because I’m supposed to react, but I hate that I’m giving off fake reactions to everything. Every time I smile I want to break my neck. But hey, I’m just a kid. And everyone will look down on me because I’m a kid, someone with no life experience and “doesn’t know real depression”. Through all the therapists and psychiatrists I’ve been through, nothing has helped.

The happy hours with my friend ended of course, but also she rarely talks to me at all just like before.

Turns out dating apps are just not for me. People don't even swipe me and on the rate occasion they do it's either a bot or they just don't respond.

I feel like every time I see a positive change on the horizon something comes and screws it up and covid is just the latest. I wish I just didn't have hope because it hurts to be torn down over and over again.

On top of all that, I know I should be thankful for what I do have because I'm pretty lucky relative to a lot of people but I can't get the negatives out of my head. I just feel shitty and feel doubly shitty for feeling shitty at all.

I was ready to accept that maybe I was just bothering him and he was being polite so I didn’t message him for 6 days. But he texted me first after that which I did not expect and it’s been 4 months since then. 

We’ve had great conversations, spent time watching movies together and playing games. 
But some cracks started to show. 2 months ago He just didn’t reply me all of a sudden and it fucked with my head for 4 days until I had to desperately try to get an answer from him. He explained to me that he’s dealt with this his whole life - sometimes he’ll have good days, other times he just has no emotional energy to reciprocate affection, feel happy or do anything. 
After a period of time he got better and he made the effort to talk to me and we continued doing our thing. 

But for half a month now he’s relapsed into a worse depressive state. I thought he was just going to leave - it’s online and it’d be so easy - and I had anxiety about it and unfortunately had to pester him for an answer. During that period i continued sending him daily care messages, telling him I missed him, stuff like that. He didn’t reply but I wanted him to at least know. 

We’re talking again, but this time he says that during the 4 months it’s been, he doesn’t feel anything from the affection I’ve shown him. Which I know not to be true as he’s reciprocated and also sounded happy at least. The kind of happy that isn’t faked just to be polite. 

He also worries that either I will leave him because I’m tired of how he is or we won’t be able to meet up in person at all because of the pandemic. I did reassure him quite a few times but I know that his intrusive thoughts can be quite bad so he feels that my reassurances don’t help?

I was brought to my pediatrician like a month ago and was told i was just having anxiety attacks and was probably depressed.

Abusive ex relationship (ie: the other day he told me he was going to “”””murder me”””” and he frequently tells me kill myself. Unfortunately I don’t have most of the text messages due to a factory reset on my phone)

The way I show myself is that I'm just another black boy on the streets but no all I really want is to be happy, be loved and have my family around even if I'm in my own room and not talking to anyone.

,depression,"This is my first time creating a thread of reddit. I'm 31 and I was supposed to finish grad school this semester. For the first time in my life I've felt real anxiety / anxiety attacks on a pretty regular basis since septembre. The prospect of not being able to finish has really got to me, to the point of affecting me physically and mentally.

I've always been pretty good at staying on time with my school work, even trying to finish early in case something happens. But this time it wasn't possible. To make it short : I think my director has been letting me down by just not reading my work or not correcting it to the point that just now i've received his real feedback ... a month and a half before the end of my studies. Today he sent me a message saying I'd need to rewrite my whole last chapter, 2 weeks before the end.He told me I can keep working on my thesis and reapply once i've touched it up (might not be able to reapply until a year has passed).

Studies were the only real thing going for me. I don't like my job. I've been so anxious about the possibility of not finishing on time that I've lost interest in my hobbies. I've got no appetite. I have trouble sleeping. I feel helpless.

I&amp;#39;m 31 and I was supposed to finish grad school this semester. For the first time in my life I&amp;#39;ve felt real anxiety / anxiety attacks on a pretty regular basis since septembre. The prospect of not being able to finish has really got to me, to the point of affecting me physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been pretty good at staying on time with my school work, even trying to finish early in case something happens. But this time it wasn&amp;#39;t possible. To make it short : I think my director has been letting me down by just not reading my work or not correcting it to the point that just now i&amp;#39;ve received his real feedback ... a month and a half before the end of my studies. Today he sent me a message saying I&amp;#39;d need to rewrite my whole last chapter, 2 weeks before the end.He told me I can keep working on my thesis and reapply once i&amp;#39;ve touched it up (might not be able to reapply until a year has passed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies were the only real thing going for me. I don&amp;#39;t like my job. I&amp;#39;ve been so anxious about the possibility of not finishing on time that I&amp;#39;ve lost interest in my hobbies. I&amp;#39;ve got no appetite. I have trouble sleeping. I feel helpless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I feel like a failure. I&amp;#39;ve cried all day. Contemplating what to do with myself. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve let down my whole family. Future is bleak.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Have been on Prozac for about a year + seeing a therapist practicing EMDR for about a year now for anxiety. I've always thought what I had was something else aside from just anxiety, but people kept telling me I have anxiety not depression. So I've stuck along with it.

Today, my psychiatrist told me that I'm right, this is a major depressive disorder. Not anxiety.

I don't feel like I have depression the way it's depicted in media or the way I've heard about it from other peers or people on reddit. So I feel like I'm a fraud. I still wake up in the mornings to make coffee and do work but it all derails and just becomes this scraggly mess of self-loathing for the rest of the day. 

What does your MDD look like? Do other people feel like their depression isn't in the same form as others? Do other people still function on some level?

Hope someone can relate. I'm scared about going into this period of switching medication over. Ever since I was a teenager I've been craving for someone to tell me it has to be something besides anxiety, it *has* to be. And now that I have that answer, I just want to curl into a ball.

Im not a person, im an empty husk of something that could&amp;#39;ve passed as a person perhaps 5 years ago&lt;/p&gt;

Considering that being a musician is my source of income, this has led me to have financial issues along with my confusion about why I just don't feel like creating anymore and it's just become extremely stressful. 

I wake up anxious and sad and I just don't have the energy to do anything anymore. I try to exercise as much as possible and I read and journal every day to help organize my thoughts. But even with all that, I still don't want to do anything.

Friday I decided that I would take a few days off from music completely hoping that it would reignite my passion and now I really don't have much to do. 

My guess is the lack of social interaction and not being able to actually experience life that has come with covid has taken a toll on my inspiration. As a creative, I get my inspiration from living life and being around people. Now I just lay in bed all day watching tv shows and listening to music with no will to get anything done. I still force myself to take care of my administrative work to keep my business running as much as I can but it all just feels pointless right now. 

Every time I think about it the same question keeps popping up in my head. Why am I doing this? What's the purpose of sitting here creating music all alone? I love being in the studio with my artists but due to covid, I can't do this right now.

As soon as I got into middle school, it got worse, because I was either ignored completely or insulted for it. I tried making up for how I look, despite loathing myself for it, with being smart, and trying hard.

That never helped, I was still always ignored or teased. Middle school was supposed to be better for me, or so I thought, because I just came out of a severe drug addiction (at the age of 10, but thats america for you) and my abusive neglectful mother had just died.

As soon as I got to highschool I gave up on everything. And the self loathing is still as strong as ever. Im more ignored than teased now, which is somehow worse.

,depression,"For context: I am 29F and I've worked part time at a public library for the past five years. We've been closed to the public since late March and started offering curbside pickup for holds and printouts in June.

This will be a very long post (Tl; dr at the bottom) and it will reveal how toxic I really am. I've made peace (ironically) with the fact that I'm a toxic person, but I still feel social pressure to hide my toxicity from coworkers, because I don't want them to get hurt by my depression vortex (except that one guy who I would hate even if I didn't have depression, he can go kick rocks). It's not their fault.

I enjoy being in a library setting and I'm grateful I even have a job, but something I've noticed in recent months is that it's getting harder and harder for me to hide my depression at work. There are a few coworkers who know about my mental health issues (which also include anxiety and OCD tendencies, along with a shopping addiction and hoarding.) But overall, I am a very private person and do my best to present a calm, upbeat, cheerful exterior. This is exhausting of course, and adds to my sense of hollow emptiness, but I'm sure some of you can relate.

The facade is slipping though, and I'm too tired to try to maintain it. More than once in the past week a coworker has found me totally spaced out, dissociating and staring into space. When having conversations with someone, it's almost impossible for me to focus on what they're saying. I look at them and nod, but in my mind I'm screaming ""Oh my god, shut the fuck up, I don't care what you did this weekend."" I've noticed, too, I've become careless about making dark jokes. Someone cautioned me to be careful when taking a book delivery outside, so that I don't get hit by a car, and I said, ""I should be so lucky."" (Note: I am not currently suicidal.) They laughed, but their eyebrows shot upward, and I could see concern in their eyes. Whoops!

I've become a miserable, selfish, nasty person on the inside. At this point, I really believe this is the ""real me"" and I can't bear the thought of going back to the fake ""happy me"" that my coworkers are used to. The one good thing about being mostly silent and withdrawn is that after a while, people will (usually) leave you alone. 

I'm wondering if my impatience and disgust with my coworkers stems from the fact that we've all been spending so much time together, without patron interactions as a buffer. One person in particular, who I'll call ""Gabe,"" really grates on me. Gabe is a loud, extroverted, overly talkative, nosy, bossy, know-it-all person who seems to get a thrill out of telling other people what to do and correcting them. I've hated him since day one, secretly of course. We had this interaction today:

Gabe (after a few attempts to make me laugh and I didn't react the way he wanted): By the way, I know I kind of butted in on one of your conversations last week, and I want to apologize. I feel bad about it.

Me, internally: *Well! So you DO have a scrap of self-awareness, it seems! At least you know you're an insufferable asshole. Is this apology for one conversation, or does it include all the other conversations of mine you've butted in on and taken over with your ridiculous monologues?*

Me, out loud: No worries! I've already forgotten it! \*cheery false laughter\*

Gabe: Also laughs, and thankfully keeps his distance the rest of the night.

Now, if I was in a healthier state of mind, this could've been an opportunity to express my feelings of frustration with Gabe. We could've had a ""real"" conversation and cleared the air, and we'd probably both be better for it. But in my current mindset, such things are impossible. I've never been able to express myself or share my real thoughts or feelings. I just say what I think the person wants to hear and that's all. No wonder I'm filled with repressed rage!

To top it all off, I'm scheduled to work this Friday with Gabe. Four hours, just him and me, checking books in. FUCK. I said I'd come in as a favor to someone but this was before I knew Gabe was going to be there too. I have a therapy appointment that day, which I could easily reschedule for the morning. But now I'm wondering if I should tell the manager who arranged this that I forgot I have an appointment that day. UGHHHH FUCKKKKKKK I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DOOOOO

I said I&amp;#39;d come in as a favor to someone but this was before I knew Gabe was going to be there too. I have a therapy appointment that day, which I could easily reschedule for the morning. But now I&amp;#39;m wondering if I should tell the manager who arranged this that I forgot I have an appointment that day. UGHHHH FUCKKKKKKK I DON&amp;#39;T KNOW WHAT TO DOOOOO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: Depression has made me into a toxic, fucked up weirdo and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to conceal this fact from coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"To preface this, I do talk to a therapist weekly, and she's GREAT, but this is something that I don't think she, or anyone, can actually help me with. I think I'm just posting it here to see if anyone understands...

Since I was a kid, there's been a part of me that wanted to ""do something big/important."" A lot of it was, and some probably still is, tied up in my ""people will love me if I'm special, right?"" sentiments that I haven't quite been able to shake since I was very young.

However, that feeling really pushed me to learn and research and grow and involve into a person that genuinely wants to help people and lessen suffering in this world--and a part of me likes the person that I've become, in that sense. I had big dreams as a teenage of ending homelessness, ending world hunger, helping eradicate disease, saving children from abusive families... You name it, I wrote about it in my journals (which I still have, even though I'm in my 30s now).

Of course, as I aged, I learned that the world wasn't a place where any of those things were easily solvable; and, worse, that there are whole swaths of people who don't want things to change. I became somewhat bitter towards humanity in general, while still wrestling with that feeling of wanting to, as 16-year-old me said it, ""change the world.""

Now, fast forward a bit. I'm 33, I've worked as a teacher for a few years , I volunteer in a church, I've tutored kids basically for free at schools, I got a Masters specifically for the sake of being able to help people...but I feel like it's not enough.

I'm not anyone special. I don't have a lot of money. I don't have any influence or power. I can't change the world even a little bit, and I feel like I'm staring into a huge, dark pit when I think too much about it. I'm a tiny candle in the darkness...and I'll never be anything more. My life isn't going to have a lot of consequence, and that frustrates me to no end. 

I know, in my head, that I should keep working towards making small changes. I can't help every kid, but I can help the ones I can reach, for example. And I can't save everyone from danger, but I can donate and volunteer for causes that can reach people in danger. And I've been doing that.

But I know it's not enough, and I've been thinking the last few years that nothing's going to change, so why even bother? I can't influence anything, or anyone, really; certainly not on a scale that matters. So, what's the point? I'm no one. I'm nothing. My family and friends love me, but in the grand scheme of things, I'm insignificant. 

I've wrestled with very low self-esteem my whole life, but at least there used to be general optimism there about the world. Now there...nothing. I feel like there still a sense of ""purpose,"" but I'm starting to think that I should actively ignore it, or even subvert it.

Maybe I am one of those people who are just too weak to maintain hope forever. My innate nihilism will always win out, it seems. 

And so, at the end of the day, my life feels meaningless. And then I don't know what to do. Should I just start living for myself? Is it even too late for that? And if I do even that... What's the point of life anyway?

And I can&amp;#39;t save everyone from danger, but I can donate and volunteer for causes that can reach people in danger. And I&amp;#39;ve been doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know it&amp;#39;s not enough, and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking the last few years that nothing&amp;#39;s going to change, so why even bother? I can&amp;#39;t influence anything, or anyone, really; certainly not on a scale that matters. So, what&amp;#39;s the point? I&amp;#39;m no one. I&amp;#39;m nothing. My family and friends love me, but in the grand scheme of things, I&amp;#39;m insignificant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve wrestled with very low self-esteem my whole life, but at least there used to be general optimism there about the world. Now there...nothing. I feel like there still a sense of &amp;quot;purpose,&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;m starting to think that I should actively ignore it, or even subvert it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am one of those people who are just too weak to maintain hope forever. My innate nihilism will always win out, it seems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, at the end of the day, my life feels meaningless. And then I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Should I just start living for myself? Is it even too late for that? And if I do even that... What&amp;#39;s the point of life anyway? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I used to want to &amp;quot;save the world&amp;quot; as a kid; now I&amp;#39;m too jaded and can&amp;#39;t even come up with a decent purpose for my life.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I have a good for nothing older brother who is 31. Four years ago, he had a job in another city but one day decided to quit and came back home. He told my mom that his job was stressful and he needs 1 year to change his field and will be back on track. My mom agreed and he was focusing on his career but 3 months later he found some girl and stopped studying. He started spending his savings on this girl and soon he would ask money from my mom. He would scream at her and create huge scene if she refused.

Suddenly, I lost my sweet mom last month. I wanted to do so much for her but it's not going to happen. I already lost my father when I was in school. I'm having a huge mental breakdown. He has no remorse whatsoever.

After mom's death my brother said he will start to look for a job from January and said needs two months time to brush up his skills. At the same time he kept on crying how his job is stressful. I suggested him to switch into my field which is equally good and less stressful and I told him I will teach him all necessary skills required. I gave him two days to make up his mind what he wants to choose. He agreed to switch into my field. I clearly stated he needs to put atleast 6 hours daily.
He would only give 1-2 hour. He spends most of the time with other broke people and complains how much his leg hurts by going out. One time he even unplugged his laptop charger while I was teaching him and told me he needs to rest. I pay for all the electric bill, grocery, internet, phone bills and all other things which is required to run a house. Now he's asking me money so he can eat expensive cakes, restaurant food etc and wants me to support him till March (earlier he said January). He's aware 35% of my income goes into my personal loan still he has no shame. He wakes up at 11:30 am then sleeps again in the evening (sleeps for almost 12 hours a day).

He keeps on lying to relatives from my father's side how he's been working all the time. All the people from the neighbourhood thinks he's working from home. He mentions to them how I'm not eating much and he's scared that I might go into depression. They think he's a very responsible and caring brother. I paid for all my mom's hospital bill (which I'm proud of) but everyone thinks he paid it. Now everyone keeps on advising me to not take stress but they don't know the real story. If I tell them truth about him it would probably turn into a huge fight.

How come he's not aware what kind of situation we are in? I thought mom's death would change him for good. I never wanted a lavish lifestyle. I just wanted a simple life but he's not allowing me to do so. I don't have enough money to move out. If I ask to split house he will just turn all family and neighbours against me and say how I always hated him and I'm so selfish and we would probably end up fighting.

I even have my aunt trying to guilt trip me into taking care of all the expenses at my grandmother's house. She's unmarried and stays at grandmother's house. This means I would end up paying her bills aswell. She's even aware that my brother does not work. She has 6 more sisters and countless nephews and nieces. Why not ask them? Still she would ask me. She has no shame.

I never signed up for any of this. How come I'm suffering and my brother is enjoying every moment of his life? I'm not able to concentrate on my work and I might even get fired this month if I don't deliver results. I had huge plans for myself but none of this is happening.

,depression,"I don't even know anymore. I would not say, that I am depressed, but I am sad, really sad. It has to do something with my mood swings probably, as my mood changes in a instance. I want to be hugged by someone, I want people to care about me. But I'm such a bad of a person, that I should not even try to be like that, I should not try, to get friends, even though, I need them the most. 

I told my mum, that I want to see the psychiatrist, but she said, that she does not see anything wrong, as I am such a good liar, she cannot see that.

I am worried, about myself, about my friends. I just don't feel like I deserve them and at the same time I need them so badly.

I honestly don't even know, why I'm writing this, or if it makes any sence. Again, I just feel like an attention whore every single second i breathe. As I've seen many times. I don't want to end my life, I'm not strong enough to do almost anything, nor this thing, I just don't see the point in living. I'm such a horrible person which did horrible things. I've hurt others, and I don't want to hurt anyone else anymore, so I lie silent. 

Panic attacks. I did no mentioned them yet. They are the worse. My dad was present, when I had one. But still, he will not act on it. I cry, and shake, my muscles hurt. I would scream, as I did when I had my first. But I can't. Others might worry. So I am gaging my mouth, tears rushing down my face, trying to hurt myself by kicking or punching into things, as I don't feel pain. I want to feel something else but anger or sadness. I want to be hugged. I want to be safe. I want to cry while other people watch, as I would finally not be afraid to do so.

I am sorry. For wasting your time as you've had to read it. And for my English. I'm sorry. You should not be reading this. Nobody should. But I will still upload this... Because, well.

But I&amp;#39;m such a bad of a person, that I should not even try to be like that, I should not try, to get friends, even though, I need them the most. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told my mum, that I want to see the psychiatrist, but she said, that she does not see anything wrong, as I am such a good liar, she cannot see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am worried, about myself, about my friends. I just don&amp;#39;t feel like I deserve them and at the same time I need them so badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t even know, why I&amp;#39;m writing this, or if it makes any sence. Again, I just feel like an attention whore every single second i breathe. As I&amp;#39;ve seen many times. I don&amp;#39;t want to end my life, I&amp;#39;m not strong enough to do almost anything, nor this thing, I just don&amp;#39;t see the point in living. I&amp;#39;m such a horrible person which did horrible things. I&amp;#39;ve hurt others, and I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt anyone else anymore, so I lie silent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panic attacks. I did no mentioned them yet. They are the worse. My dad was present, when I had one. But still, he will not act on it. I cry, and shake, my muscles hurt. I would scream, as I did when I had my first. But I can&amp;#39;t. Others might worry. So I am gaging my mouth, tears rushing down my face, trying to hurt myself by kicking or punching into things, as I don&amp;#39;t feel pain. I want to feel something else but anger or sadness. I want to be hugged. I want to be safe. I want to cry while other people watch, as I would finally not be afraid to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry. For wasting your time as you&amp;#39;ve had to read it. And for my English. I&amp;#39;m sorry. You should not be reading this. Nobody should. But I will still upload this... Because, well. I&amp;#39;m worthless and I don&amp;#39;t care for others. I&amp;#39;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Since I was a toddler my parents would always make fun of me and use me as a joke to tell to family and friends. They, mostly my mom, would alway say I was ungrateful, misbehaved, weird, stupid, fat, annoying, dirty, etc. that I was such a bad kid I’ll probably never have a girlfriend or get married. That if it wasn’t for how other people would see them they would throw me on the street for a week for me to learn how to appreciate what I have and how good I have it. That when they grow up in the Dominican Republic they never had what I did and that I had my life made thanks to them. I never thought they loved me even though they would say all the time but then start screaming hateful shit at me and my sisters cause of small things like leaving a CLEAN plastic spoon an a table. Saying we are making a mess and leaving garage everywhere. What would people think if they saw this they would think I raised and live with fucking animals. 

I hated when they start screaming out of nowhere about some thing. I hated more that they fought all the time and I thought they were going to get a divorce. They would fight a lot about me and how I was a bad kid  and stuff. I just thought it was my job since I was the reason they’re fighting to try to fix their marriage. I thought if I fixed their marriage they would love me and forgive me and stop hating me.

All I ever wanted was their love and I tried as hard as I could in kindergarten and 1st grade. I thought that if I did well that they would stop fighting all the time and act like the parents on tv. Talk with me instead of telling me to leave them the fuck alone or go bother someone else with your stupid shit. For my mom to stop telling me I need to work extra hard at school cause am not bright and need to amount to something or I’ll end up on the street as some drug addict and die alone. For my dad to stop calling me a fag and smacking me on the head and calling me idiot every time I say something he thinks is dumb or wrong, just cause am sitting near him or as a good morning/ how you doing. I tried so hard to prove that I was a good son to them cause I thought if I did they would love me more and it would stop them from getting a divorce. That I could stop being afraid of them and actually believe them when they said “I love you”.

So when I was 6 my neighbors had a family friends niece who was 16 live with them for a bit. Since my parents and the neighbors where friends she would sometimes come over to hang out and stuff with my sisters(10, 5) and cousins if they where over since we had a lot of family live close to us. I hated her something about her just had me on edge every time I saw her. I thought she was suspicious and that I couldn’t trust her. I got it in my head that she was evil and I would repeatedly check on what she was doing when she was over cause I just know she was up to something.

One day I confronted her about it and all it took was her complementing me and being really nice for me to let down my guard. Once I did that she ask if I liked her and I said no but she kept pushing. Saying that if I had a girlfriend my parents would be proud of me, that if she was my girlfriend she’d make me happy. The shit that any pedo says to a kid but my dumb ass almost bit the bait and told her I would love to for my parents to be happy for me that I got a girlfriend but that I didn’t like her. So she changed her approach and saying it was probably for the best i was a baby so probably didn’t know what it meant to have a girlfriend let alone kiss. I got mad and told her I wasn’t a baby and she told me to prove it so I kissed her. She got me hook line and sinker and pressured me to have sex and raped me. It went on for like 2 weeks then she moved back home without a word to me.

I was devastated I had my chance to make my parents proud just disappear. I believed all the shit she said about getting married and that we where in love and my parents would be happy. A part of me know she was lying that she was just using me as some sick toy to play with but I just so wanted to be loved and to believe my parents would be happy about me for once and that would somehow fix their marriage. That I went along with it and told myself that this was my chance to live a happy life with parents who cared and were happy instead of neglectful uncaring and mad.

After she left it felt like I was hollow and I just couldn’t put on the mask of the perfect son anymore. I just stopped caring and just sunk into dark pit of sadness loneliness rage and finally lost hope. After a year my parents noticed something was wrong I stopped talking, smiling, eating, being around family, being positive, etc. but they just chalked it up to me being weird like always. Thankfully the next year when I was 8 the school noticed that something was wrong and had me go to the schools counselors. They said that I have anger management issues and adhd but that I should see a psychiatrist since they thought that the 2 problem by themselves wouldn’t have called such a dramatic and sudden shift from A+ student to failing in everything over one summer.

I loved going to the therapist she made me feel like she actually listened to me and cared how I felt. She helped me with my anger and helped me actually feel motivated to go to school. Going there made me happy instead of feeling sadness and crushing loneliness all the time. After awhile I started feeling safe their and told her about one time when I was playing with a bread knife while Family was visiting. I was playing with the bread knife by cutting pieces of garlic toast them my mom made and she got mad and told me stop. She wanted me to play with cousins but they were playing with a basketball and I was having fun cutting bread so I ignored her and kept doing it. Then someone threw the ball too hard and it flew across the room at me. Everyone yelled and I turned around in time to see the ball coming at me. So without thinking I threw the knife at it to stop it from hitting me. My mom got furious and put me in the stairwell to the basement and closed the door on me. She yelled at me through the door to sit there and learn my lesson. 

One of my uncles opened the door and let me out and all of them defended me that it wasn’t my fault, that I did mean to do it , that I wasn’t like I hurt anyone, etc. so my mom backed down and when everyone left she got mad at me for embarrassing her in front of everyone. The therapist called my mom in and had me tell her what I told her. My mom tried to make translate for that I was lying and I have an overactive imagination. I got made and said no that she was heartless for saying that something that hurt me so much was a lie without even feeling bad just or caring how I felt. After she saw that I yelled something in Spanish she asked what was it that I said and before I could say anything my mom steps in with her weak English saying that am acting up, lying, that am over reacting that she only yelled at me and never put me into the stairwell. I got mad and told her she was the liar and that if she loved me she’d see that it hurt me and say sorry even if it was made up. She got mad a told me to shut up be for she hit me and that she’ll deal with my lying when we get home. The therapist was going to ask me something but my mom interrupted and made up some reason that we had to leave 10 minutes and dragged me out of their.

She was really mad at me and said that my lying embarrassed her hurt her and then went on a screaming rant that basically if they come to take me and my sisters away it’s my fault for breaking up our family. I told her that I didn’t care that if they take me away any family is better then this one since she’s willing to lie about what happened know that it hurt me and if anyone is the blame if they take us away it’s her for being a bad mom. After my justified tantrum I thought she was going to hit me, yell at me, throw me out, and a small part of me thought she was going to kill me. Instead she just called me heartless and a bad son and ignored me for a while and didn’t let me go back to the therapist.

With my dad already ignoring me and sisters ignoring me for being a mamas boy, for the first time no one said anything if I didn’t say anything to them first and ignored me when I walked into a room. So I ignored them back cause I felt hurt but after a few days I actually liked it. To be able to walk around the house without having to worry about being questioned all the time or nitpicking/ calling me weird for things like walking to a chair and eating at the same time instead of sitting down before I eat. I didn’t feel like every little thing I did was under a microscope that I finally had some breathing room. It didn’t last long till my mom tried to bring me back into the fold by trying to hug me and tell me she loves me all the time again while still berating me and my sisters almost everyday cause she thought giving birth to us meant us signing a contract to be indentured servant‘s instead of her fucking kids.

After a while of her I gave in and I hated myself for still even wanting her love after what happened. It wasn’t long after that I found a baby bird whose nest fell into the snow. I couldn’t leave him their in the cold while it was raining so I took him home. It took me arguing and begging for an hour for my parents to let me keep him. I fell in love with that bird after taking care of it for only 2 days. It was the first time I felt happy and not alone in a long time. I would stay up every night to sneak into the living room to talk with him and show him drawings of the birdhouse I was going to make him. One day after school I was so sleepy cause I stayed up almost the whole night watching him sleep that I need rest so I told my younger sister and cousin if they could feed him while I took a nap.

When I woke up they ran up to me and saying sorry and my head went blank and I just saw myself just stood their while they apologized and tried to explain what happened through tears. I couldn’t understand what they were saying I heard the words but it just sounded so alien that I couldn’t get what was happening . When I realized that they stopped talking I ran to him to check on him and he was dead. Since he was a baby he had to be fed and drink from syringes and they gave him too much too quickly and chocked on it. 

I was devastated I cried the rest of the day and the next day I was still crying so my parents let me stay home. The 2nd day they where mad at me for still crying about him and let me skip school again to have a mock funeral and bury him thinking that I’d get over it quicker. The third day I was crying harder then yesterday so my dad yelled at me to stopping being a fag and man up and stop crying over nothing. When that didn’t work my mom screamed in my face to stop or else she’ll smack me across the face and if I did man up and act my age(8 years old basically an old man at that point) she’ll hit me and ground me and if I cry at school and embarrass her she’d find some relative to take me cause she was fed up with my shit.

I stopped crying cause I was so scared that they’d do just that and I went to school. When i came home they acted like nothing happened, kept acting like they were the greatest parents and I was a monster for not seeing that. They asked if I was hungry and I blow and told them if you hate me so much why would you care and went to bed. They came in later and said sorry if I felt bad for being made to go to school even when am sad but it’s important and I have to go. Completely missing the the obvious reason why I was upset and saying shit like I know why you don’t want to go to school I didn’t either when I was a kid. I didn’t look at them I just said nothing and they took it as me accepting their no apology and rolled with it. 

They started acting nicer to me but when they weren’t blowing up in fits of rage screaming about how horrible of kids we were( mostly mom). One time I pushed her away from me when she tried to hug me and told her not to talk to me. It was in front of family so they all asked me why I’d push my own mom away. They know I loved hugging people so they wanted to know what’d she did that got me upset and I got scared. It was the first time in a while that someone asked me about me or how I felt that wasn’t just pleasantries and I panicked and just walked away without saying anything to hide in my room. My mom just brushed it under the rug and said it was cause I was mad at her for not letting me use the baby birds death to skip school a third day.

By the time I turned 9 my depression got really bad and suicide was always on my mind. Thinking of ways that I could kill my self without having my parents mad at me or hate me and hit me if I lived through it. After a while I found a gun in my dads drawer and I made a plan to kill my self in that moment. I didn’t want to die I just wanted the pain and suffering to be over with already. So I put the gun back and said if I really can’t handle it I’ll always be here and managed to walk away. After a couple weeks I just broke down one evening and couldn’t take it. I just wanted it to stop the thoughts, pain, emptiness, sadness, rage, and loneliness i just wanted it all to stop but I was too afraid so I flipped a coin if it heads I have to keep living and tails I can finally end it.

When the coin landed head I felt cheated and did it again and got heads. I got so mad why couldn’t I get what I really want for once in my life. So after flipping it a third time I finally got tails but I didn’t feel happy like I thought I would. I was confused why wasn’t I happy I got the results I was hoping for so what if I cheated who fucking cares right. So I climbed out of the window and sneaked out of the house to get some air and think. I got on my bike and when I got to the corner I saw I car turning on to the street was going to cross way too fast. He barely made the turn hitting the stop sign and nicking a car. I thought that it was my chance that finally I can end it and I pushed my bike on to the street. I looked at the car and closed my eyes and drunk driver saw me in time to slam on his brakes. He stopped and got out to yell something about how he almost killed a kid that he was sorry and that I was stupid for stopping in the middle of the road and that I should head home that my parents are probably worried.

I went home and they yelled at me for sneaking out and for almost getting myself killed. That if I even loved them I wouldn’t be so retarded to do something so dangerous as ride my bike at night. When I flipped the coin again just cause it landed head and I just cried my self to sleep. When I woke up on Saturday I realized that yeah no one cares about and no one likes me and everyone hates me but as long as I like me and that I care that’s one more then 0. So I told myself to stick through it till I can move out or they divorce and I can ask the judge to put me in foster care. 

I tried to stick it though I really did I told my self every time I thought no care or that everyone hates that it doesn’t matter cause I care I like me. At 11 we moved to another state and I felt even lonelier I lost what little friends I made and my parents didn’t care about how we felt. I tried to kill my self my hanging in my closet at 13 but after i passed out I came too a few minutes later a saw that my shit knot came apart. When I was 16 I grabbed a pill bottle out of my parents room. I took the whole thing before going to sleep but I still woke up the next day just nauseous and my parents still made me go to school even I I stayed dry heaving cause they thought I was faking.

I passed high school and started college with 5,000 in debt cause I was so scared and anxious about filling out the fasa that I just never got it done. So before I could go and to my dorm I had to sign loans so that the tuition was low enough that my parents could pay. They were not happy that I got a partial scholarship and still couldn’t so something so simple. After I failed most of my classes and started smoking weed in the first year I dropped out. I told my parents that I was going to a community college nearby cause I was so scared of disappointing them. I kept the lie going for 2 years till I finally had to come clean. By that point I already got a shit paying job as a security guard. I was 20 and the look of disappointment they gave when they found out was a different kind of hurt then they usually made me feel. It was worse I couldn’t chalk this up to them being mean or them not caring.

I truly felt like I deserved this that I deserve to hurt not cause I cared how they saw or thought of me( for the most part). I felt like I deserved it cause I lost myself I let the darkness eat away at me so long that I stopped caring about myself again. I lost hope in myself and started to hate myself again without even caring that I did. I failed myself cause I was too scared to show up to some of my classes and to nervous and anxious of failing to do most of my assignments. I failed myself cause I stopped caring about what I want in life and focused on what would other people want from me. I failed myself cause I lost hope in myself and crumbled at the slightest pressure. I failed myself cause I stopped seeing what I loved about me and what made me who I am and just focused on the negative.

I failed myself cause I know I need help I wanted help but I was just so afraid that I couldn’t ask. I’ve told myself so many times not to believe the intrusive thoughts, Not to grow used to the emptiness and loneliness, Not to succumb to the rage and sadness, but I let it happen cause the one thing I fear most is believing that I could accomplish something, that I am worth something, that I can be happy with myself, that I won’t feel alone my whole life cause if I did believe Ill just be some idiot who believed in a fucking quarter to tell him if he should live or die. So I bought 3 bottles of  over the counter sleeping pill and I was going to take them, but I told myself if I go through with it’d just be one failure.

I hated myself even more how could I be so stupid. How could I let myself down like that after everything. I hated myself for not being strong enough to help myself while ignoring that the reason I hated myself was cause I kept hating myself. I used my realization not to push myself up but to keep knocking myself down. I kept hating myself for failing for a while. I ended up transferring to a new site and I really liked it. My coworkers their we really nice and I got to know them. I got to hear how hard life was for them and how hard they had to work to get to a stable life piece by piece talking with them. They made me feel like I wasn’t I massive failure that I was just  a person with a rough life who some how survived and will find a way to keep surviving.

I stopped hating myself so much and the thoughts were quieter and less frequent. The pain sadness loneliness rage got more manageable. For once I didn’t feel so empty inside. For once in my life it actually felt like it got better. The year I worked their was chaotic, stressful, annoying, boring, stupid, and exhausting but the people I met and the experiences are something that really affected me and help me grow for the better. It helped me see that just I think am broken just cause I feel empty that am not that I can get better I can be better and that I only really fail myself when I stop fighting for my self and give up to the darkness.

The security contract at the place ended last week so I probably won’t see them again unless the place I was a guard at hires me to work there. I put in the application before I left cause I would love to keep working with them but I don’t need it cause I left with something that I went in without, hope. Not the lip service I told myself but never believed but actual hope. I’ve always wanted to make a post hoping that if I did that all of you would magically give me that hope that I can get better do better in my life. That making some post would help me overcome my fear that even with therapy I could never get better cause I was too broken beyond repair. I’m not broken and I don’t need to be fixed cause theirs nothing wrong with me. The fact that am 21 and scared of calling the therapist isn’t something I should be ashamed about.

The fact that I’ve lived so long in so much pain proves that am strong. the fact I’ve kept going despite the fear of having to live with this pain forever shows that am brave. I’ve just never been truly honest with myself that I need help, that I love myself and that I care. If am going to be honest with myself then I need to stop trying to be strong by living with the darkness and pain. If am going to be honest with myself need to stop trying to be brave by pushing through. If am going to be honest I need realize that if I truly am truly strong truly brave that I need to reach out for help but not the same half assed I don’t care if I get the help that I need cause I’ll still be here that I have for years. I need to be honest with myself that I’ve ignored getting help cause I was afraid, that I didn’t truly try to get help not cause no one would care but cause I was afraid that people wouldn’t care so I never tried to get them to care. That’s why I making this post not for anyone but me myself and I.

Am making this post as I sign to myself to stop lying to myself and the people who want to help me just cause am afraid. That the fear is why I need to be honest to myself and those around me cause if I am not honest that am so afraid of losing my life to depression that am letting it slowly rob my life away how can I ever believe that I truly love myself. So this me writing it to stone that I will get better and that all the pain, sadness, rage, emptiness, darkness, guilt, shame, and isolation over the year wasn’t just cause I was afraid. It was the fear that gave me the excuse to let it keep on. That the reason I left myself get to this point wasn’t just that I was afraid. That I used that fear to beat myself down cause I couldn’t be honest with myself that it was ok to be afraid. That the fear of not being able to get better was just the other side of the coin. That I couldn’t be honest with myself that I did have hope that I could get better but chose to ignore it for the other side of the coin. That the fear that I couldn’t get better shows that I have hope that I could I was just ignoring it for the side that was easier, simpler, and less consuming cause I didn’t want to believe. I didn’t want to believe that I should live that I deserve to live when I flipped that quarter cause I already got tails in my heart but just like I could keep flipping the quarter till I got tails why not flip my fear into hope cause the only person that can stop me is me and i know that I fucking care and this is I sign to myself that I always have and always will.",t2_57pig5e8,False,,0,False,I just need to get this out sorry that its really long,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k464gt,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606801690.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I was a toddler my parents would always make fun of me and use me as a joke to tell to family and friends. They, mostly my mom, would alway say I was ungrateful, misbehaved, weird, stupid, fat, annoying, dirty, etc. that I was such a bad kid I’ll probably never have a girlfriend or get married. That if it wasn’t for how other people would see them they would throw me on the street for a week for me to learn how to appreciate what I have and how good I have it. That when they grow up in the Dominican Republic they never had what I did and that I had my life made thanks to them. I never thought they loved me even though they would say all the time but then start screaming hateful shit at me and my sisters cause of small things like leaving a CLEAN plastic spoon an a table. Saying we are making a mess and leaving garage everywhere. What would people think if they saw this they would think I raised and live with fucking animals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hated when they start screaming out of nowhere about some thing. I hated more that they fought all the time and I thought they were going to get a divorce. They would fight a lot about me and how I was a bad kid  and stuff. I just thought it was my job since I was the reason they’re fighting to try to fix their marriage. I thought if I fixed their marriage they would love me and forgive me and stop hating me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I ever wanted was their love and I tried as hard as I could in kindergarten and 1st grade. I thought that if I did well that they would stop fighting all the time and act like the parents on tv. Talk with me instead of telling me to leave them the fuck alone or go bother someone else with your stupid shit. For my mom to stop telling me I need to work extra hard at school cause am not bright and need to amount to something or I’ll end up on the street as some drug addict and die alone. For my dad to stop calling me a fag and smacking me on the head and calling me idiot every time I say something he thinks is dumb or wrong, just cause am sitting near him or as a good morning/ how you doing. I tried so hard to prove that I was a good son to them cause I thought if I did they would love me more and it would stop them from getting a divorce. That I could stop being afraid of them and actually believe them when they said “I love you”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I was 6 my neighbors had a family friends niece who was 16 live with them for a bit. Since my parents and the neighbors where friends she would sometimes come over to hang out and stuff with my sisters(10, 5) and cousins if they where over since we had a lot of family live close to us. I hated her something about her just had me on edge every time I saw her. I thought she was suspicious and that I couldn’t trust her. I got it in my head that she was evil and I would repeatedly check on what she was doing when she was over cause I just know she was up to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I confronted her about it and all it took was her complementing me and being really nice for me to let down my guard. Once I did that she ask if I liked her and I said no but she kept pushing. Saying that if I had a girlfriend my parents would be proud of me, that if she was my girlfriend she’d make me happy. The shit that any pedo says to a kid but my dumb ass almost bit the bait and told her I would love to for my parents to be happy for me that I got a girlfriend but that I didn’t like her. So she changed her approach and saying it was probably for the best i was a baby so probably didn’t know what it meant to have a girlfriend let alone kiss. I got mad and told her I wasn’t a baby and she told me to prove it so I kissed her. She got me hook line and sinker and pressured me to have sex and raped me. It went on for like 2 weeks then she moved back home without a word to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was devastated I had my chance to make my parents proud just disappear. I believed all the shit she said about getting married and that we where in love and my parents would be happy. A part of me know she was lying that she was just using me as some sick toy to play with but I just so wanted to be loved and to believe my parents would be happy about me for once and that would somehow fix their marriage. That I went along with it and told myself that this was my chance to live a happy life with parents who cared and were happy instead of neglectful uncaring and mad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After she left it felt like I was hollow and I just couldn’t put on the mask of the perfect son anymore. I just stopped caring and just sunk into dark pit of sadness loneliness rage and finally lost hope. After a year my parents noticed something was wrong I stopped talking, smiling, eating, being around family, being positive, etc. but they just chalked it up to me being weird like always. Thankfully the next year when I was 8 the school noticed that something was wrong and had me go to the schools counselors. They said that I have anger management issues and adhd but that I should see a psychiatrist since they thought that the 2 problem by themselves wouldn’t have called such a dramatic and sudden shift from A+ student to failing in everything over one summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved going to the therapist she made me feel like she actually listened to me and cared how I felt. She helped me with my anger and helped me actually feel motivated to go to school. Going there made me happy instead of feeling sadness and crushing loneliness all the time. After awhile I started feeling safe their and told her about one time when I was playing with a bread knife while Family was visiting. I was playing with the bread knife by cutting pieces of garlic toast them my mom made and she got mad and told me stop. She wanted me to play with cousins but they were playing with a basketball and I was having fun cutting bread so I ignored her and kept doing it. Then someone threw the ball too hard and it flew across the room at me. Everyone yelled and I turned around in time to see the ball coming at me. So without thinking I threw the knife at it to stop it from hitting me. My mom got furious and put me in the stairwell to the basement and closed the door on me. She yelled at me through the door to sit there and learn my lesson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my uncles opened the door and let me out and all of them defended me that it wasn’t my fault, that I did mean to do it , that I wasn’t like I hurt anyone, etc. so my mom backed down and when everyone left she got mad at me for embarrassing her in front of everyone. The therapist called my mom in and had me tell her what I told her. My mom tried to make translate for that I was lying and I have an overactive imagination. I got made and said no that she was heartless for saying that something that hurt me so much was a lie without even feeling bad just or caring how I felt. After she saw that I yelled something in Spanish she asked what was it that I said and before I could say anything my mom steps in with her weak English saying that am acting up, lying, that am over reacting that she only yelled at me and never put me into the stairwell. I got mad and told her she was the liar and that if she loved me she’d see that it hurt me and say sorry even if it was made up. She got mad a told me to shut up be for she hit me and that she’ll deal with my lying when we get home. The therapist was going to ask me something but my mom interrupted and made up some reason that we had to leave 10 minutes and dragged me out of their.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was really mad at me and said that my lying embarrassed her hurt her and then went on a screaming rant that basically if they come to take me and my sisters away it’s my fault for breaking up our family. I told her that I didn’t care that if they take me away any family is better then this one since she’s willing to lie about what happened know that it hurt me and if anyone is the blame if they take us away it’s her for being a bad mom. After my justified tantrum I thought she was going to hit me, yell at me, throw me out, and a small part of me thought she was going to kill me. Instead she just called me heartless and a bad son and ignored me for a while and didn’t let me go back to the therapist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my dad already ignoring me and sisters ignoring me for being a mamas boy, for the first time no one said anything if I didn’t say anything to them first and ignored me when I walked into a room. So I ignored them back cause I felt hurt but after a few days I actually liked it.

It didn’t last long till my mom tried to bring me back into the fold by trying to hug me and tell me she loves me all the time again while still berating me and my sisters almost everyday cause she thought giving birth to us meant us signing a contract to be indentured servant‘s instead of her fucking kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while of her I gave in and I hated myself for still even wanting her love after what happened. It wasn’t long after that I found a baby bird whose nest fell into the snow.

Thinking of ways that I could kill my self without having my parents mad at me or hate me and hit me if I lived through it. After a while I found a gun in my dads drawer and I made a plan to kill my self in that moment. I didn’t want to die I just wanted the pain and suffering to be over with already.

&lt;p&gt;I truly felt like I deserved this that I deserve to hurt not cause I cared how they saw or thought of me( for the most part). I felt like I deserved it cause I lost myself I let the darkness eat away at me so long that I stopped caring about myself again. I lost hope in myself and started to hate myself again without even caring that I did. I failed myself cause I was too scared to show up to some of my classes and to nervous and anxious of failing to do most of my assignments. I failed myself cause I stopped caring about what I want in life and focused on what would other people want from me. I failed myself cause I lost hope in myself and crumbled at the slightest pressure. I failed myself cause I stopped seeing what I loved about me and what made me who I am and just focused on the negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed myself cause I know I need help I wanted help but I was just so afraid that I couldn’t ask. I’ve told myself so many times not to believe the intrusive thoughts, Not to grow used to the emptiness and loneliness, Not to succumb to the rage and sadness, but I let it happen cause the one thing I fear most is believing that I could accomplish something, that I am worth something, that I can be happy with myself, that I won’t feel alone my whole life cause if I did believe Ill just be some idiot who believed in a fucking quarter to tell him if he should live or die. So I bought 3 bottles of  over the counter sleeping pill and I was going to take them, but I told myself if I go through with it’d just be one failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hated myself even more how could I be so stupid. How could I let myself down like that after everything. I hated myself for not being strong enough to help myself while ignoring that the reason I hated myself was cause I kept hating myself. I used my realization not to push myself up but to keep knocking myself down. I kept hating myself for failing for a while. I ended up transferring to a new site and I really liked it. My coworkers their we really nice and I got to know them. I got to hear how hard life was for them and how hard they had to work to get to a stable life piece by piece talking with them. They made me feel like I wasn’t I massive failure that I was just  a person with a rough life who some how survived and will find a way to keep surviving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped hating myself so much and the thoughts were quieter and less frequent. The pain sadness loneliness rage got more manageable. For once I didn’t feel so empty inside. For once in my life it actually felt like it got better. The year I worked their was chaotic, stressful, annoying, boring, stupid, and exhausting but the people I met and the experiences are something that really affected me and help me grow for the better. It helped me see that just I think am broken just cause I feel empty that am not that I can get better I can be better and that I only really fail myself when I stop fighting for my self and give up to the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security contract at the place ended last week so I probably won’t see them again unless the place I was a guard at hires me to work there. I put in the application before I left cause I would love to keep working with them but I don’t need it cause I left with something that I went in without, hope. Not the lip service I told myself but never believed but actual hope. I’ve always wanted to make a post hoping that if I did that all of you would magically give me that hope that I can get better do better in my life. That making some post would help me overcome my fear that even with therapy I could never get better cause I was too broken beyond repair. I’m not broken and I don’t need to be fixed cause theirs nothing wrong with me. The fact that am 21 and scared of calling the therapist isn’t something I should be ashamed about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that I’ve lived so long in so much pain proves that am strong. the fact I’ve kept going despite the fear of having to live with this pain forever shows that am brave. I’ve just never been truly honest with myself that I need help, that I love myself and that I care. If am going to be honest with myself then I need to stop trying to be strong by living with the darkness and pain. If am going to be honest with myself need to stop trying to be brave by pushing through. If am going to be honest I need realize that if I truly am truly strong truly brave that I need to reach out for help but not the same half assed I don’t care if I get the help that I need cause I’ll still be here that I have for years. I need to be honest with myself that I’ve ignored getting help cause I was afraid, that I didn’t truly try to get help not cause no one would care but cause I was afraid that people wouldn’t care so I never tried to get them to care. That’s why I making this post not for anyone but me myself and I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am making this post as I sign to myself to stop lying to myself and the people who want to help me just cause am afraid. That the fear is why I need to be honest to myself and those around me cause if I am not honest that am so afraid of losing my life to depression that am letting it slowly rob my life away how can I ever believe that I truly love myself. So this me writing it to stone that I will get better and that all the pain, sadness, rage, emptiness, darkness, guilt, shame, and isolation over the year wasn’t just cause I was afraid. It was the fear that gave me the excuse to let it keep on. That the reason I left myself get to this point wasn’t just that I was afraid. That I used that fear to beat myself down cause I couldn’t be honest with myself that it was ok to be afraid. That the fear of not being able to get better was just the other side of the coin. That I couldn’t be honest with myself that I did have hope that I could get better but chose to ignore it for the other side of the coin. That the fear that I couldn’t get better shows that I have hope that I could I was just ignoring it for the side that was easier, simpler, and less consuming cause I didn’t want to believe. I didn’t want to believe that I should live that I deserve to live when I flipped that quarter cause I already got tails in my heart but just like I could keep flipping the quarter till I got tails why not flip my fear into hope cause the only person that can stop me is me and i know that I fucking care and this is I sign to myself that I always have and always will.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I know that going to reddit about this stuff might not be the best solution, but I don't really know what else to do (sorry about venting, I think I just need to). I just feel like I'm an awful person and I know that if my friends knew every bad thing I've done they'd hate me. I feel like every time I speak with them I'm lying to them and that they only like me because they aren't always there for everything. Each time I manage to tell myself ""it's okay, everyone makes mistakes"" about one thing, there's another mistake, screw up, or hurtful thing I've done or another lie I told that I really can't be open about that pops in my head.

I try to be an accepting, kind person, but then I do the exact opposite and just be a hypocrite. For example, there was a person I knew when I was 16 (I'm 18) who had autism. I was always trying to be supportive and none judgmental to him, I listened to him talk about his experiences and chatted with him and all. But despite it all, I did get frustrated and say ignorant things when he didn't pick up on sarcasm. I at one point said ""I thought the context made it obvious"" that I was being sarcastic, which I very quickly realised was stupid and ableist to say, but I was then too awkward to bring it up. Our classmates later said they disliked him and I kind of agreed (not because of stuff like that, he just had a habit of saying harmful and offensive things, though not maliciously, and putting celebrities on a pedestal even if they did some horrible things, stuff like that. He's not a bad person though, I feel like I wasn't patient enough with him) but one of them said in regards to him having difficulties due to his autism that he's autistic too and he's not like that and I sort of went ""yeah"" but I very much believe that there's no ""right"" way to be autistic or neurodivergent at all, so it's another time when I believe one thing and say something else. That happens so often and while there are some things that I would never agree with in any context, I think sometimes I just put up the pretense of being a good person, but I mess up too often to actually be one. There are a lot of mistakes and a lot of things I've done that I wish I could undo and change, but I know that's not how life is and I hate that I'm like this. 

Another time I met this person at a convention and I guess I kind of didn't think about the fact that they were 3 years younger than me (they were 13). She started messaging me and she was quite...I don't wanna say possessive, but if I didn't reply instantly, she'd send me a bunch of messages asking where I was and if everything was okay and if I hated them. When I say instantly, I mean within like 10 minutes. Anyway, I told them I won't be near Instagram every second and sometimes I'm in class, so I couldn't answer, and they got really upset and said ""why don't we come up with a code if you can't respond?"" By that point I was frustrated, because I guess I don't like feeling like it's an obligation to be accessible at all times, so I way too harshly responded something like ""we don't need a stupid code, just understand I won't be able to always reply instantly"". She was only 13, I really should have been understanding how difficult that age is and how self conscious you can be. I was impatient and cruel and I really regret the way I responded, because at the end of the day, her concerns came from a worry that I hated them, not out of anything else.

Those are just a couple instances, but I feel like I have hurt a lot of people and told a lot of lies and been hypocritical and two faced. Times I've snapped at people and lashed out. Things like that.

My default setting is basically guilt and regret and I know it may be selfish to want to end it all, but every day this stuff weighs on me and I feel like breaking down over guilt and shame and the idea that I could have seriously harmed somebody. I know what it's like to be hurt and I can't ever forgive myself for possibly contributing to the pain and difficulty somebody was going through. I try and tell myself that it's not possible to go through life without hurting people and that this is not fiction where we only see parts of a character's story, in real life you experience every moment of your life and that's going to result in a ton of mistakes, but I kind of stopped looking forward to the future and the idea of living into (proper) adulthood has felt like a pain and a chore with little chance of a pay off. Whatever I do, it will just contribute to another thing I messed up. I can't ever recall any good that I've done, only the bad and the hurtful and cruel, and I don't have much motivation to live at this point.

I guess my question would be, is there any way to start to forgive yourself? I don't know if I deserve to after how many screw-ups I've done, but I really don't want to feel like I have nothing to live for. I'm trying to be a better person, but it's not helping too much with feeling like this.",t2_476t9btw,False,,0,False,"I feel like the only reason I don't kill myself is because I know how much it would hurt others, but I can't forgive my mistakes",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k45xfi,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606801137.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that going to reddit about this stuff might not be the best solution, but I don&amp;#39;t really know what else to do (sorry about venting, I think I just need to). I just feel like I&amp;#39;m an awful person and I know that if my friends knew every bad thing I&amp;#39;ve done they&amp;#39;d hate me. I feel like every time I speak with them I&amp;#39;m lying to them and that they only like me because they aren&amp;#39;t always there for everything. Each time I manage to tell myself &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s okay, everyone makes mistakes&amp;quot; about one thing, there&amp;#39;s another mistake, screw up, or hurtful thing I&amp;#39;ve done or another lie I told that I really can&amp;#39;t be open about that pops in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to be an accepting, kind person, but then I do the exact opposite and just be a hypocrite. For example, there was a person I knew when I was 16 (I&amp;#39;m 18) who had autism. I was always trying to be supportive and none judgmental to him, I listened to him talk about his experiences and chatted with him and all. But despite it all, I did get frustrated and say ignorant things when he didn&amp;#39;t pick up on sarcasm. I at one point said &amp;quot;I thought the context made it obvious&amp;quot; that I was being sarcastic, which I very quickly realised was stupid and ableist to say, but I was then too awkward to bring it up. Our classmates later said they disliked him and I kind of agreed (not because of stuff like that, he just had a habit of saying harmful and offensive things, though not maliciously, and putting celebrities on a pedestal even if they did some horrible things, stuff like that. He&amp;#39;s not a bad person though, I feel like I wasn&amp;#39;t patient enough with him) but one of them said in regards to him having difficulties due to his autism that he&amp;#39;s autistic too and he&amp;#39;s not like that and I sort of went &amp;quot;yeah&amp;quot; but I very much believe that there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; way to be autistic or neurodivergent at all, so it&amp;#39;s another time when I believe one thing and say something else. That happens so often and while there are some things that I would never agree with in any context, I think sometimes I just put up the pretense of being a good person, but I mess up too often to actually be one. There are a lot of mistakes and a lot of things I&amp;#39;ve done that I wish I could undo and change, but I know that&amp;#39;s not how life is and I hate that I&amp;#39;m like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another time I met this person at a convention and I guess I kind of didn&amp;#39;t think about the fact that they were 3 years younger than me (they were 13). She started messaging me and she was quite...I don&amp;#39;t wanna say possessive, but if I didn&amp;#39;t reply instantly, she&amp;#39;d send me a bunch of messages asking where I was and if everything was okay and if I hated them.

,depression,"2020 has been a helluva year for everyone. I feel like it chose to attack me personally. After battling depression for 20+ years I’ve gotten pretty good at handling stress and bad thoughts. But this year has beaten me down.

I have never been so scared of the next day in my life and I’m so afraid of tomorrow (tomorrow specifically, not the concept of tomorrow) that I can’t even breathe right now. I have major life event stress bingo. And all of it culminates in my ability to handle the month of December flawlessly. 

This year I’ve had a deployment that was made even harder by the pandemic. I went to a therapist for anxiety and after enough sessions was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. I’ve begun transitioning medically but caught a pharmaceutical mistake where I was prescribed 8 times the maximum strength of the medication I was on, so I feel like I’m having to do the doctors work for him. I’m Leaving a career I’ve had for 6 years, and tomorrow is the mandatory appointment I HAVE to keep in order to quit 10 business day later (military rules).

I have to be 2800 miles across the country ready to start college and my new job by the 28th and the vet bills killed my financial resources to ship my car, so I’ll have to drive cross country in a car that may or may not make it and miss out on my daughter’s 2nd Christmas. I still have to find an apartment there. My grandma broke her hip last month and they doubt she’ll make it another year. I couldn’t go to my grandpas funeral because of the Army but they live 9 hours away and I have a window of 8 days to clean and prep my house to be inspected by the landlords, visit my grandma, say goodbye to my wife and daughter for a few months since I’m moving by myself at first, and begin a 42 hour drive.

I feel like every single thing that could go wrong or be stressful has hit me all at once and I can’t breathe at all. It’s like I was given a nearly impossible deadline but I wasn’t allowed to start on time. Tomorrow is when the clock begins and I’m weighed down by every single thing. 

I don’t know if I can handle tomorrow. I don’t know if I need help but I have nobody to talk to and I just needed to write it all out.

&lt;p&gt;I have never been so scared of the next day in my life and I’m so afraid of tomorrow (tomorrow specifically, not the concept of tomorrow) that I can’t even breathe right now.

,depression,"11/30/2020: 

So for about a year now I've been out of touch from reality, I've gone through a massive transition period where I managed to overcome my GAD, and moderate depression. Long story short at 17 years old, nearly a year after being in a mental ward for a few days, I'm still struggling on engaging with my surroundings. This has impaired me from reaching my full potential in life. Everything seems to be blurred for me in a way, I have a really difficult time on reading books and just ""absorbing"" what's on the page. I have to think relatively hard to do some more subtle tasks. I've figured out it's because I'm not even engaging with what I'm doing in the first place. I've been emotionally numb for a while but it's starting to go away after going on a trip on Thanksgiving break. I've been able to decompress myself for the first time in nearly a year, helping me engage ever so slightly more, but still not where I want to feel like again. I'm experiencing a blur, a literal disconnect. Through every therapist I've been through I've described it as Saran wrap where I can see what my potential is on the other side but can't tear through it. I've changed my diet, started exercising, have tried 2 weeks of no FAP, a full 1 day dopamine detox, experimented with teas and other coffees and have tried meditation, but nothing i've done has allowed me to tear through. 

I want to see the smaller details in life again, being able to read something and actually comprehend what I'm reading, I want to be emotionally whole again so I can go after the girl I'm talking to.

I haven't been able to fully understand this sensation and trying to describe it, despite my self-awareness towards it. I feel it's a form of DPDR but I am having a difficult time overcoming it.

I'll keep y'all posted as I make further progress on overcoming this.

,depression,"I'll try and keep it short. Me and my ex were seeing each other less and less because of my new job and we fought more often about the simplest things. But I loved her deeply and with all my heart. We just slowly grew apart because our lives, professional and personal, were just heading in different directions. We tried to make it work but it just wasn't happening.

One day, I come home to find a note on the kitchen counter. She told me she was leaving me for someone else, someone she went to school with that she met on Tinder but she said she wasn't cheating and hadn't actually done anything with him. She just felt a better connection with him. I nearly cut my wrists then and there but cried my eyes out instead and threw a chair against the wall in anger and made a huge hole.

Them, that Friday, I decided to try my best to forget about her and got black out drunk. I remember going to the bar and then going back outside intoxicated, but I eventually found myself standing at a bridge that went over a little lake that was plenty enough deep. I decided that now was the time and that instead of continuing to feel sorry for myself, I'd just save myself the misery and end it now. I climbed up and stood looking down at the water for a few moments before jumping in. Let me remind you all that it was chilly weather where I'm at and was jumping into probably 40 degree Fahrenheit water.

I don't remember floating or being underwater though. The next thing I remember is a guy with a bald head and big white beard like Santa looking down at me trying to wake me up, with another guy around my age next to him. After coughing up water for a few moments, I saw I was on land and immediately started to break down again. The guy around my age had went in and pulled me out, and he and the bald guy dragged me back up on land. I looked around and saw a small crowd of people had gathered by this point and I kept crying. The next thing I saw was ambulance lights and a few paramedics and cops came over and helped sit me up. I told them I tried to kill myself and gave them the whole story of my breakup and all of that.

The bearded man, whose name was Henry, sat on the other side of me and just listened to the story as I kept crying and just didn't know what to do with myself. He said that he lost his wife two years ago and was in a similar situation, considering ending his life and not wanting to be without her. I also spoke with the police and, in a rare act of kindness not often seen these days, one of the officers drove me home. I threw up as soon as I got inside my apartment and went to sleep.

So that's my story. I haven't tried to do it again since, but I'm still not in a great place. I don't hate her, by the way, my ex. I don't.

,depression,"**Hello** r/depression **members,**

We are Pharmacy students at the University of British Columbia co-leading The End: A Hopeful Chapter of Life initiative.

Death continues to be a taboo subject within the general public and many may feel uneasy while engaging in conversations with their loved ones about this topic. The need for discussions around end-of-care life is a vital aspect of fulfilling patients’ wishes for the management of health towards the later stages of life.

This project aims to raise awareness about the importance of advance care planning and to normalize conversations around end-of-life care. We hope that the collated responses to these questions will promote self-reflection on one’s health care wishes and allow others to have a greater insight on this topic.

Initially, we planned on organizing and delivering in-person workshops with senior organizations in partnership with the BC Health Coalition in order to raise the awareness of end-of-life care. However, due to the current pandemic, we had to think of alternative ideas. We decided to do this through the platform of an online website. We collaborated with a software engineer to create a public participatory art that consists of two thought-provoking questions, and we hope to capture responses from across age groups and geographical locations. 

Please feel free to learn more and participate in our public participatory art by clicking on the link below: [http://www.hopefulchapteroflife.com/](http://www.hopefulchapteroflife.com/)

I just feel that I have nothing anymore. I have no one. I reach out to my friends and they act as if I’m joking. It’s like I’m drowning and everyone is just stood watching.

This past week has been painfully difficult. Unbelievably difficult for me. My best friend decided they just don’t want me in their life anymore, cut all contact. I’m not an easy person to deal with but my god did I try for him. I was doing my best to be the friend he deserved, I guess he got tired of waiting.

My family don’t even notice I’m there, and when they do I’m in the wrong no matter what I do. Nothing I do is good enough and I just seem to be the punching bag for all their shit.

I think... no I know I’m being pushed out of my job. My boss has taken all my work from me and left me with nothing. Making me useless. I questioned him and he made it my fault for taking a couple sick days last week. I couldn’t tell him I just couldn’t get out of bed. He’s a toxic boss, gaslights and manipulates. I used to love my job, now I cry on my way to work.

I feel as though nothing is worth it anymore. If I disappeared, nobody would care. Nobody would notice. My existence feels like an inconvenience to everyone around me. I go to bed hoping I don’t wake up. I wake up hoping I don’t make it to bed. I drive to work hoping a HGV will sideswipe me and just end it all. Or that a car will cut me up and force me to drive into the barrier. 

I drive across a big bridge for work every day, and I just think how easy it would be to stop my car, walk to the railing and jump. Finally be free of this mental torment and this hell of a life I’ve created.

All I want is for someone to show me they care. Show me that life is worth it. Prove to me that things get better.

,depression,"Tldr at bottom.

I haven’t been professionally diagnosed, but I think that I’m depressed (suicidal since age nine (I’m 15, now), no longer enjoy doing things that I used to like, no motivation to even get out of bed by myself).

I’ve thought that rats are pretty cool pets for the past few years, but was never allowed to get them. My parents agreed to let me have some recently with the conditions that they stay in my room and I take care if them without anyone else’s help (my parents will buy things that I need, though). The thing is, I’m doubting my ability to give them the care they need.

For anyone who doesn’t know, rats need to be purchased in pairs, given ~1 hour of play time a day, and have their litter/bedding switched out frequently, among other things.

I have a dog at my dad’s house who I love a lot, but most days I’m too tired from doing nothing to even play with her/get dressed to take her for walks. It’s okay in that case because I have a lot of siblings that like walking her instead, but if I have to do everything for the rats...

I don’t know. I’m just not sure if I’ll be able to work up the motivation to play with them, even though I’m sure that I would enjoy it.

What have been your experiences with buying pets? Do you think that it might work out, or should I give up on the idea. I really want some and have heard that they can be good therapy pets, but I don’t want them to have a poor quality of life because I’m too depressed to care for them properly.

P.S: Rats only live about two years and I’m not planning to commit suicide until the beginning of college, so you don’t need to worry about the rats having no one to take care of them.

Tldr: I have wanted pet rats for years and my parents finally agreed to get some.

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. I’m just not sure if I’ll be able to work up the motivation to play with them, even though I’m sure that I would enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have been your experiences with buying pets? Do you think that it might work out, or should I give up on the idea. I really want some and have heard that they can be good therapy pets, but I don’t want them to have a poor quality of life because I’m too depressed to care for them properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S: Rats only live about two years and I’m not planning to commit suicide until the beginning of college, so you don’t need to worry about the rats having no one to take care of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tldr: I have wanted pet rats for years and my parents finally agreed to get some. However, I’m now doubting my ability to care for them properly due to my lack of motivation/energy caused by depression.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello, I am asking for help really... I am a 26 year old living with my brother in our now deceased grandfathers house. My mother and uncle are receiving the entirety of the house and are planning on selling it. I currently have a good paying stable job, and I'll be okay once the house is sold but my brother is now jobless and I fear for his future.

My brother has had a troubled childhood, abused by my father (firstborn problems are real lol) I had received I guess a little less? Still got ""abused"" by father. Mainly verbally and psychologically. But I have coped with what I've been dealt with. I deal/dealt/in the processing of dealing with problems but this isn't about me... My brother has not coped well with adulthood. He is depressed, I'm no shrink but I believe he has bipolar as he is ALWAYS up and down...

Today however he had a rage, and I do mean LITERAL rage. It gave me actual anxiety... I had to walk away. He's always had these (been living and taking care of Grandfather due to him having(haved) cancer, and World wide Pandemic...) He has always had social anxiety since highscool and its honestly gotten worse... It's hard to live with him and he is starting to give me anxiety. I'm not one to get anxiety and I've always tried to stay positive and make him stay positive, but I can't anymore... It's depressing me now, I feel like he's dragging me down, ALWAY's wondering if he wont hurt himself.

,depression,"so

in the bad times of my life

i have always used different coping strategies

sometimes ive combined them, sometimes ive developed new ones

let me make a list
- eating (i was obese for a long time)
- drugs (i used over 30 different substances, some of them were a habit, including benzodiapenines and opiates)
- stealing (i went stealing stuff from stores when i felt bad, sometimes little, sometimes large things. i got pretty good at it, until i got caught over a stolen nuisance, and never triedagain)
- video games (i was horribly addicted to them at one point)
- exercise (after my time of obesity, i started doing sports everyday, working out often until i almost passed out over months. when i could not exercise due to injury i felt useless and depressed)

so ive tried all of these, and now its covid, and i think i found a new, very toxic way to cope: tinder. seriously, this is so toxic, i have a hard time writing about it. the secret to not being afraid of rejection, of not having to wait for texts, is to have an entire queu of girls who are waiting to text to you. its fun, its real fun, but i noticed recently how obsessed i've become with it. if i would have to stop today, there would be nothing left, i am already feeling like shit most of the time, without tinder, without the women i text and meet, there would be nothing left.

i know that this is toxic, wrong, and i should probably be ashamed of what i am doing. but returning to drugs is not an option, it is too cold to exercise outside and i am injured, stealing is not an option aswell as i do have a record, and i will never return to gaming.

Without getting into a long story of when it all started and how it affected me growing up, I want to explain that I have hidden my issues like a champ.

I could talk to her about anything at all. And she never left my side. Until, of course, she did.

,depression,"Self-Imposed Distance and the Break Up

I’ve struggled with connecting to others. Not entirely, I can do it well enough to get by. I have good friends, I’m close with most of my family, and I feel I can get along with most people. That’s all well and good. 

However, I feel that I don’t connect with people as much as I could. The reason being is I’m afraid of what would happen if I become too relaxed around people. Much of my early childhood consisted of being picked on and not having many friends. So naturally, I partially closed myself off, keeping to myself, and not imposing myself in any situation (like at all). Eventually, these actions even carried over to interacting with some of my family. 

So, it’s clear that I put this on myself, no matter how much I’ve been told not to worry. But I can’t get out of my own head. 

This carried on with every person I came into contact with, every person I befriended. Until one person came along. Without a word, this person pulled me out of my own head. My walls were torn down with just a look. In that moment, I became totally relaxed, truly connected with another person. 

We ended up dating for a couple of months. This person didn’t want to at first, but it was agreed to just see where it went. Eventually, it got sort of serious. I was head over heels from the start, so this development was a dream. 

At some points, there were concerns that not all of the feelings were mutual, at least not in intensity. But we moved forward. 

Then, in March, the break up came along. I was absolutely shattered. The one person who could make me feel the way I did, for the first time in my life, didn’t want to be with me. It wasn’t because a lack of love, but a lacking of being in love. We’ve talked some since, and some help has been given to me by this person afterwards. I tried to be mature about it all, to hide my feelings and eventually move past them. To continue as friends. But I let how I feel show too much, and I’m sure at the result of them not wanting to talk to me anymore. It hasn’t been said, in fact it’s been denied. But I can’t believe it. Now, I’m sure I’ve ruined the possibility of even a friendship. 

When we do talk, I initiate it, and, while I’m sure they can guess, I’m never asked how I’m doing. 

What’s sad is that we have been broken up longer than we dated. You’d think that I’d be over it, or at least better than this. But how does someone come back from something like this? How do I move on from having the closest connection that I’ve had with anyone? I’ve been wandering in the pitch black darkness, without a light, and with a shattered heart. I’m just hurting all the time, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’d have more hope, if more people were interested in me. Spoiler: it was/is barely anyone. 

I’m hope taking medication will help. But Im doubtful that it will. 

What do I do?

&lt;p&gt;At some points, there were concerns that not all of the feelings were mutual, at least not in intensity. But we moved forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in March, the break up came along. I was absolutely shattered. The one person who could make me feel the way I did, for the first time in my life, didn’t want to be with me. It wasn’t because a lack of love, but a lacking of being in love. We’ve talked some since, and some help has been given to me by this person afterwards. I tried to be mature about it all, to hide my feelings and eventually move past them. To continue as friends. But I let how I feel show too much, and I’m sure at the result of them not wanting to talk to me anymore. It hasn’t been said, in fact it’s been denied. But I can’t believe it. Now, I’m sure I’ve ruined the possibility of even a friendship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we do talk, I initiate it, and, while I’m sure they can guess, I’m never asked how I’m doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s sad is that we have been broken up longer than we dated. You’d think that I’d be over it, or at least better than this. But how does someone come back from something like this? How do I move on from having the closest connection that I’ve had with anyone? I’ve been wandering in the pitch black darkness, without a light, and with a shattered heart. I’m just hurting all the time, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’d have more hope, if more people were interested in me. Spoiler: it was/is barely anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hope taking medication will help. But Im doubtful that it will. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry for how long this was, but thank you for reading. Hope y’all are doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression," I \[22F\] have hated myself since grade 9. I’ve been bullied, told I was fat in unimaginably creative ways, and have heard “kill yourself” a few times. I had planned to commit the summer after grade 10, and was preparing everything 2 weeks beforehand. The day came and I was too much of a coward to go through with it. Since then, I have lived with the goal to pay back my parents before anything.

A little backstory, my parents immigrated from China to Canada when I was 4 years old. It was hard for them when they first got here. They had little money and it was the dead of winter. They would tell me stories of how I would get sick frequently and they would have to take turns carrying me to the hospital in the snow on foot. Growing up, I always held my parents to the highest regard, and they treated me well. They never laid a hand on me.They always bought me what I wanted growing up (usually only when they’re on sale), and I was fortunate enough to be able to enjoy a childhood of pokemon and mario games.

Since high school, I’ve suffered through symptoms of depression, anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, borderline personality disorder, and ADHD. I’ve fought against them quietly for 5 years. Being asian, this is normal (not voicing my ‘feelings’), and I grew up rarely ever shedding a tear in front of my parents. The ways I’ve learned to cope was through self harm, alcohol, pills, sex, etc. (not here looking for criticism about these because I know they are bad)

Ever since the start of university, I’ve been on different medications for my mental disorders. (Fun fact: I decided to major in psychology so I could hopefully gain some insight on how I’m so fucked up having an objectively decent childhood). I’m currently taking antidepressants and stimulants.

The issue started last year. After my ex I was head over heels for dumped me, I, as many would, was crying in bed. My dad comes home after a long day of work and does not see me at the dinner table. He proceeds to storm up the stairs and rage at me for not waiting for him downstairs. At this point I broke down. I was pulled down to the kitchen island, where I cried hysterically about how I didn't want to live, and how I’ve been suffering for years. That I've lived this long for them. Although my ideations were not caused by the break up, my break down to my parents was.

Since then, I’ve broken down 2 more times. The worst thing I heard was the second time I broke down, when my dad said he was disappointed. Not that I wasn’t able to get the help I needed for my depression growing up, but that he ended up with a daughter like me. That ruined me. The most recent argument we had ended up with him telling me I’m selfish. That me bringing up my suicidal ideation only hurts my mother, and doesn’t achieve anything else. I feel guilty.

&lt;p&gt;A little backstory, my parents immigrated from China to Canada when I was 4 years old. It was hard for them when they first got here. They had little money and it was the dead of winter. They would tell me stories of how I would get sick frequently and they would have to take turns carrying me to the hospital in the snow on foot. Growing up, I always held my parents to the highest regard, and they treated me well. They never laid a hand on me.They always bought me what I wanted growing up (usually only when they’re on sale), and I was fortunate enough to be able to enjoy a childhood of pokemon and mario games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since high school, I’ve suffered through symptoms of depression, anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, borderline personality disorder, and ADHD. I’ve fought against them quietly for 5 years. Being asian, this is normal (not voicing my ‘feelings’), and I grew up rarely ever shedding a tear in front of my parents. The ways I’ve learned to cope was through self harm, alcohol, pills, sex, etc. (not here looking for criticism about these because I know they are bad)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the start of university, I’ve been on different medications for my mental disorders. (Fun fact: I decided to major in psychology so I could hopefully gain some insight on how I’m so fucked up having an objectively decent childhood). I’m currently taking antidepressants and stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue started last year. After my ex I was head over heels for dumped me, I, as many would, was crying in bed. My dad comes home after a long day of work and does not see me at the dinner table. He proceeds to storm up the stairs and rage at me for not waiting for him downstairs. At this point I broke down. I was pulled down to the kitchen island, where I cried hysterically about how I didn&amp;#39;t want to live, and how I’ve been suffering for years. That I&amp;#39;ve lived this long for them. Although my ideations were not caused by the break up, my break down to my parents was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve broken down 2 more times. The worst thing I heard was the second time I broke down, when my dad said he was disappointed. Not that I wasn’t able to get the help I needed for my depression growing up, but that he ended up with a daughter like me. That ruined me. The most recent argument we had ended up with him telling me I’m selfish. That me bringing up my suicidal ideation only hurts my mother, and doesn’t achieve anything else. I feel guilty. And I have no clue if I’m in the wrong or right anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

A bit of my background.

As a kid i moved between countries a lot because of my parents' work and at first i loved it however I never managed to make any real friends...

When i turned 18 i came out to my family as gay, but no one accepted me, the environment was just too hostile to live in, being threatened every day was just so exhausting and i decided to leave my home and country and try to find happiness elsewhere, while keeping very little contact with my family.

I am 26 now and in the last 7 years i moved quite a bit, for University, work, ex boyfriend etc, and last year i had to move back home in order to fulfill my national service in the army... unfortunately it still is obligatory and if i dont do it, i will have problems renewing my passport or re-entering the country. It was a horrible experience, because the army is just so homophobic and i had to hide who i am in order to keep my physical integrity...

The very next day of finishing the army, i started looking for a job outside my country, i got through many interviews and by July i actually got an amazing job offer in Barcelona/Spain. I did not hesitate at all, took it straight away and i moved to Barcelona in September. Now it's been just over 2 months that i am here, the current situation with Corona has not allowed me to make any friends at all, i have met people but i know none of them actually consider me a friend and everytime i messaged them and suggested to meet up for something, its always the same asnwer ""yeah sure, i will let you know"" and i can see on social media they go out a lot but never invite me... Even before Corona i found it hard to make friends... they just never seem interested enough to invite me for anything...

All i do now is work from home and then either go for a walk or spend the rest of the day in my room watching Netflix or a little bit of gaming on my pc.

At first i loved going for walks as it helped me clear my head and exercise but now it only makes me feel worse, i go out and all i see is people in groups, friends, couples, families and i am walking between the crowds feeling like a shadow, like i don't exist.

Sometimes the emotions become so hard to hold in so i will go somewhere isolated so people don't see me crying.

,depression,My fiance and I split up the other day and I'm a fucking mess. We've been together for 4 years and this passed year has been the hardest. We've been fighting more and she's been going out more with her friends. I've been trying so hard to keep it together but I've been suicidal for months now and I let it drive a wedge between us. I let it get the best of me and kept it a secret. The blame isn't all on me though. The final straw was I caught her texting someone else. She claims it was never more than text but it still crushed me. I believe what she said but I acted out of pain and anger and broke things off. She also hid pain she was dealing with as well. We had an abortion 2 years ago and she still holds the weight of that in her heart. I had no idea and I wish I could've helped her through that. A few months back while we were having sex I yawned (because I'm a fucking idiot and couldn't hold it back). I was just so tired and had gone through a lot. It crushed her when I did that. From there it was really downhill and here we are now. We talked yesterday and we both still love each other very much but there is a lot of pain and broken trust now. I told her I forgive her and want to make things work. I told her I'm going to make the changes I need to improve myself and be more open about what I'm feeling. I asked if she wants to make things work and she is hesitant. She is afraid things will just go back to the way they were and nothing will change.

We&amp;#39;ve been together for 4 years and this passed year has been the hardest. We&amp;#39;ve been fighting more and she&amp;#39;s been going out more with her friends. I&amp;#39;ve been trying so hard to keep it together but I&amp;#39;ve been suicidal for months now and I let it drive a wedge between us. I let it get the best of me and kept it a secret. The blame isn&amp;#39;t all on me though. The final straw was I caught her texting someone else. She claims it was never more than text but it still crushed me. I believe what she said but I acted out of pain and anger and broke things off. She also hid pain she was dealing with as well. We had an abortion 2 years ago and she still holds the weight of that in her heart. I had no idea and I wish I could&amp;#39;ve helped her through that. A few months back while we were having sex I yawned (because I&amp;#39;m a fucking idiot and couldn&amp;#39;t hold it back). I was just so tired and had gone through a lot. It crushed her when I did that. From there it was really downhill and here we are now. We talked yesterday and we both still love each other very much but there is a lot of pain and broken trust now. I told her I forgive her and want to make things work. I told her I&amp;#39;m going to make the changes I need to improve myself and be more open about what I&amp;#39;m feeling. I asked if she wants to make things work and she is hesitant. She is afraid things will just go back to the way they were and nothing will change.

Because of insurance issues, I haven't been able to go to a psychiatrist or therapist in months and have mostly been doing a lot of self-help reading on bipolar and depression. I have hypomanic episodes here and there, but mostly wallow in the depressive side of this disorder. 


During my most recent hypomanic phase, as always, I decided it was time to DO ALL THE THINGS. Make all of the self-improvement changes to my life. I've since come down and I am stable now, but the drive to break bad habits and instill new positive ones is still there.


However, one of the most common themes I'm reading about is the need to allow yourself to be uncomfortable. For example, going for a daily walk = leaving my comfortable bed, changing out of my comfortable pajamas, leaving the comfort of the warm home in exchange for the cold winter outdoors, where my feet will inevitably be uncomfortable from walking. I'm making that example melodramatic, but you get my point.

,depression,"Life hasn't been going well for quite some time now. First it was work stress, but my personal life was looking up, so things balanced out and I was ok. 

Then my plans for the future kinda fell through, I'm sorta going through a breakup, and my body refuses to cooperate with my healthy eating/exercise regimen and instead chooses to gain weight day after day. And work keeps getting worse and worse. Sometimes it feel so meaningless I wonder why I don't quit. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely grateful to be healthy, alive, and have a job right now. I can easily see how things could've gone way worse this year but they didn't and that's great. But somehow knowing that what I'm going through is better than what a lot of other people are going through, and knowing that it still doesn't make me happy, just makes me feel selfish and broken and even sadder inside. 

It's like my brain has forgotten what happiness feels like. I've always wondered why meds could help people be less depressed. I suppose sometimes the chemical pathways in your brain just forget how to function, and it sucks. I've heard the story about first responders to 911 burying themselves in rubble to cheer up the search dogs who kept finding dead bodies and were getting depressed. That's how I feel now. Trying to dig out some happiness and meaning in life, even though everything feels meaningless and I can't see a purpose anymore.

I'm really hoping this is just temporary. Cause it sucks to know how awesome it can feel to be happy, and to one day just wake up and not be able to feel it again. Everything is just so sad all the time and I don't know why.

&lt;p&gt;Then my plans for the future kinda fell through, I&amp;#39;m sorta going through a breakup, and my body refuses to cooperate with my healthy eating/exercise regimen and instead chooses to gain weight day after day.

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m extremely grateful to be healthy, alive, and have a job right now.

,depression,"At the point that I'm at, my two choices are either to open up about my feelings, tell someone about how bad I feel constantly, or to shove it all down like I usually do. 

In option 1, I open up to someone, tell them I want to die, and what happens? They cry, they blame themselves, they walk on eggshells around you for months, and you have to work extremely hard to put up a façade of happiness so that they can be ok. Nothing good can come of it, at least in my position, because I don't have anybody that truly cares or that can put my emotional stability before theirs for even an instant. It's not their fault, I can't expect anybody to care about me when I can't care about myself, can I? at this point I'm not very capable of loving people anymore, and so the reward to anybody who tries to help of strengthening a relationship is not available.

In option 2, I repress the bad feelings with escapist media and drugs like I usually do, but that is obviously even worse for me. In the short term, however, I am able to function somewhat normally, and I can spare people around me from the potentially immense burden of giving a shit about my emotional stability. Long term, however, this strategy probably leads to a suicide attempt, which if discovered could hurt the people around me even worse than if I opened up to them in the first place.

,depression,"Your kind of just empty inside, you can't laugh, cry, or feel emotions that aren't just some built up character you've made for yourself.
You feel like a narcissist all the time. Apart of you hates every imperfection outside and inside, metaphorically and literally. As a kid, you were probably singled out for behaving in a socially unacceptable manner or found yourself alone with no actual friends who aren't just acquaintances from work and happen to stick around.

You can't help but make comments and statements in your head. Arguing with yourself and some pointless argument you had earlier with some random on the internet. But you were too out of it to say it quickly or had to go back to work. You spend most of your time fantasizing and painting a perfect world thats only in your head, while criticizing everything about it, along with everyone around you. 

You become a Loner, you think you have depression and want to kill yourself. But really you want to lash out against a world you feel is wrong. Like everything in it is poison, and instead of killing you it's slowly choking you and making everything as uncomfortable as possible. So you match what your feeling on the inside and push people away. And when you're at your peak. You get more self destructive and can't stop.

Suicides not the option, when it's just being angry at yourself for not being the idealized vison of your perspective of perfection. Its best to just lash it out with yourself instead of the people around you. But you can't help it, you know you shouldn't but its the part of you that wants everything to be perfect.
Once you accept that part, its just the beginning.

Because you still feel empty and nothing fills the hole inside. Your living with every imperfection, its what normal people do. No matter how shitty or cringey it was of any number of the things that you could've done. You get to continue going for that perfection and overcome that. Thats the hard part, because the world won't be the one you picture in your head. 

That's where you fall back into the cycles of repeating mistakes which will then become choice, or you can break them. But you'll always be tempted to fall back into the routine. Even doing drugs, drinking and sleeping with strangers, won't fill that hole. Its a temporary escape, making excuses for why you didn't do any of the things you at some point wanted to do. The regret being the biggest imperfection that is being unable to accept the outside world. 

Its a cycle that won't stop, but you can minimalize your damage to others by just focusing on your own issues. Even if it means your all alone, repeating the cycle of hating yourself and temporarily escaping any way you can. 

I still can't stop myself from being cruel to others, but its not an easy thing to do. Breaking the routines and habbits you hate are the only real goals you should be focused on.

We even asked her husband (married less than a year now) and he said she's been having a hard time but asked us to keep texting/calling her. 

But it's been 8 months. I can't believe her anxiety has been so bad that she can't answer a simple text the entire time. I'm angry and hurt and ready to just write her off at this point but always tell myself it's her mental health that is the issue.

I’m afraid I won’t be taken seriously, I know my mom has 0 understanding of mental illness. I just can’t find a way forward. I need help.&lt;/p&gt;

Background info: 23F (24 next week), always been an overthinker, worrier. Did okay in school and I was a hard worker. Attained my master's degree this summer. The job prospects of my field are okay. Not great (especially now), but not impossible either. I know I have the right skills and I could do well. It may take time, all things do. But I'm not sure if I have the resilience for it.  Unfortunately I'm also paralyzed by fear. Fear of underachieving, not finding a job and being an all round loser. Ever since I graduated and lost my side job around the same time bcs of the pandemic, I have fallen into this pit of despair. I can't motivate myself to do anything. I have all the time in the world. I'm off 7 days a week yet I don't do anything and words can't describe how much I hate myself for it. I live it home with my mom, so I do help around and cook for example. If I think about it, I have so much. I have health, family, great friends and I know I'm loved. But I'm sad everyday and wasted basically 6 months of my life this way. I've alwayd been sad, but at least I was a productive member of society and it distracted me of everything going on in my head. Now I don't even go outside. I have gotten amazing compliments from some people recently.  I get happy for like 10 seconds when they say positive things about me. And by then I forget. I hate myself intensely and sometimes truly believe I'm a disgusting loser. I hate myself for stupid futile things. Example : 2 bills came in oct/nov and I keep forgetting/postponing to figure that out. It's not urgent so it's nothing biggie. But it doesn't make sense to hate myself for something so small. It doesn't make sense to think I'm a loser. But I think it.

I don't think I can no longer deny I have depression. I want to beat this on my own. Finding a job would help.

Maybe I wasn’t feeling grateful enough, but I was asked to come in today. And it hasn’t been bad. Busy, but whatever. It’s busy when I’m at home too. 

But at home... I’m in pajamas, snacking, cat in my lap, music on... taking it at my pace. If I get frustrated, I say “brb” and sit on my porch for a few minutes.

,depression,"I have actually been planning to make a thread similar to this for a year...which - as you will see if you read on - coincides very well with the rest of my personality...

I am a 29 yo male, best described as a major fuckup by profession. I studied at an ""elite"" highschool in my country, had OK grades, but never really studied much after my mom let go of micromanaging my studies, thinking if I did so well up till now I would be fine on my own..

Well she was right...sort of. I did decently on my country's equivalent of SATs, and got accepted to a great university. At this point I had to start making my decisions even more, and college work was \*impossible\* , by this point I was such an awful procrastinator that I was doomed to fail. 

And so I did, dropped right out. I still remember my mom crying at the dinner table, telling me to just go become a factory worker if I completely neglect studies.

Then I reapplied to a ""weaker"" uni, thinking the problem could be solved with an easier curriculum, spoiler alert..it wasn't . At this point I was living doing the odd online jobs, something to scrape together enough money to rent a room, and to continue existing. 

I never left the house on my own accord between the ages 14-25. I had crippling social anxiety, I had issues with my looks, issues with my very self. I dropped out of 4 (yes, four) universities in total, and I wasn't even close to making it at any point. I don't think I did more than 10 hours of effective studying put together during all those years. 

Spent years basically wasting time, with anything, really games, videos, reddit, youtube. At first I thought it must be some kind of video game addiction, or whatever, but no It was not. Even back in high school, I literally sat in an empty room with only my books, and still managed to put together close to zero effective work. 

I went to study in the library during my university days, and I managed sit with my books, and decided instead to read up on nanotubes in a random book next to me ( literally). It was all so agitating, because all the while it was eating me up inside, even during those very moments.

I went back to live with my parents in the countryside after my streak of failures. My mom pushed me into a desk job, which was the most basic data entry position ever, with my lack of skill or knowledge in anything. I don't fault her, I am thankful because I am incapable of making such an effort on my own ( think I am pretty much the perfect homeless person candidate in a different universe ). 

I do odd things. Once my boss asked me to complete a task that would take at best 2 hours of active work. I finished that shit by 4 am, yes 4 am.  Stayed up all night because I can't spend more than 2 minutes focusing on work at once.

I tried learning to code, (what I went to uni for at first), but I've started the udemy classes I bought about 30 times by now, never got further than 10 minutes in, like ever.

Sometimes I literally take 5 minutes of walking up and down to start taking a shower. I actually started working out at home as well. Only issue is, it takes me roughly 3 horus to complete a 45 min routine, because I take massive breaks before and after every set....I just can't...Oh yea, and I do it at night before going to sleep, I just can't get myself to do it during the day.

So anyway...COVID came. My company let go of the weaker performers of some divisions. Needless to say, I was one of them.  My boss' words ""we know this could have been very different, but you never shown any willingness for it""

So yea, I was earning minimum wage. Which in my country Estonia is 520 euros a month. Or basically 8500$ a year for you americans. I had that for 3 years..and I never managed to move a finger to change it.

I hated work, i hated going to work, I hated my wage, everything about it. But I was powerless to make the tiniest change. 

I am sick...I know I am. There is no way a human is supposed to exist the way I do.

I've seen psychiatrists in the past, 2 times to be exact. I was diagnosed with depression both times, put on SSRI meds. 

The meds worked, somewhat, but not in the way I wished they did. My doc told me I will find joy in more things once again once we continue with the therapy, but it did fuckall for me.

My mood was improved by a lot, I wasn't a miserable person anymore, but I was still ME. Still unable to do anything productive, unable to control any of my urges. Still the weird person doing 3 hour workouts during the night. Out of a job for 4 months now, back at home living with my parents, living on my last savings.

And how does WoW come into all this you might ask? It's just something I have done for every expansion that ever released since my high school years. Come together with my friends and have a good time. 

I am too ashamed to tell them I am out of the shitty job I even had. They are all on actual career paths, with their degrees. 

Once it registered in me that I can't even afford to buy a 50 euro game to play with them, and that I am inevitably going to lie about it to them... it just felt like a nice roundoff to all my past failures.

Cried for a solid hour, then I made the decision to tell about it to some randoms on the internet. Maybe someone will read it, not that there is much of interest in here. And yea, that decision was 2 days ago and you are only just reading it now.

&lt;p&gt;I went to study in the library during my university days, and I managed sit with my books, and decided instead to read up on nanotubes in a random book next to me ( literally). It was all so agitating, because all the while it was eating me up inside, even during those very moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to live with my parents in the countryside after my streak of failures. My mom pushed me into a desk job, which was the most basic data entry position ever, with my lack of skill or knowledge in anything. I don&amp;#39;t fault her, I am thankful because I am incapable of making such an effort on my own ( think I am pretty much the perfect homeless person candidate in a different universe ). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do odd things. Once my boss asked me to complete a task that would take at best 2 hours of active work. I finished that shit by 4 am, yes 4 am.  Stayed up all night because I can&amp;#39;t spend more than 2 minutes focusing on work at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried learning to code, (what I went to uni for at first), but I&amp;#39;ve started the udemy classes I bought about 30 times by now, never got further than 10 minutes in, like ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I literally take 5 minutes of walking up and down to start taking a shower. I actually started working out at home as well. Only issue is, it takes me roughly 3 horus to complete a 45 min routine, because I take massive breaks before and after every set....I just can&amp;#39;t...Oh yea, and I do it at night before going to sleep, I just can&amp;#39;t get myself to do it during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway...COVID came. My company let go of the weaker performers of some divisions. Needless to say, I was one of them.  My boss&amp;#39; words &amp;quot;we know this could have been very different, but you never shown any willingness for it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yea, I was earning minimum wage. Which in my country Estonia is 520 euros a month. Or basically 8500$ a year for you americans. I had that for 3 years..and I never managed to move a finger to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hated work, i hated going to work, I hated my wage, everything about it. But I was powerless to make the tiniest change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sick...I know I am. There is no way a human is supposed to exist the way I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen psychiatrists in the past, 2 times to be exact. I was diagnosed with depression both times, put on SSRI meds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meds worked, somewhat, but not in the way I wished they did. My doc told me I will find joy in more things once again once we continue with the therapy, but it did fuckall for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mood was improved by a lot, I wasn&amp;#39;t a miserable person anymore, but I was still ME. Still unable to do anything productive, unable to control any of my urges. Still the weird person doing 3 hour workouts during the night. Out of a job for 4 months now, back at home living with my parents, living on my last savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how does WoW come into all this you might ask? It&amp;#39;s just something I have done for every expansion that ever released since my high school years. Come together with my friends and have a good time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am too ashamed to tell them I am out of the shitty job I even had. They are all on actual career paths, with their degrees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it registered in me that I can&amp;#39;t even afford to buy a 50 euro game to play with them, and that I am inevitably going to lie about it to them... it just felt like a nice roundoff to all my past failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cried for a solid hour, then I made the decision to tell about it to some randoms on the internet. Maybe someone will read it, not that there is much of interest in here. And yea, that decision was 2 days ago and you are only just reading it now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sorry to all of those who put faith in me ever being a useful human being in any measureable way. Sorry for disappointing you, though I hope none of you ever read this.&lt;/p&gt;

Today in my online zoom discussion for mental health i brought up the negative stigma about medications for mental health and depression and the personal shame people sometimes feel internally and externally when they take these medications.

And as if to prove my point about the negative stigmas, a classmate then responds by saying she agrees but that antidepressants are also only supposed to be a temporary fix and won’t cure you. 

And while i partially agree that in *some* cases medication only needs to be used temporarily for depression, it just made me feel personally invalidated.

Feeling numb after breakup, is this a normal thing? I’m confused about my feelings. So, I have a history of depression/depersonalization and anxiety. I often feel numb anyways. However, while we were dating I wasn’t numb towards her but I was towards family members and in my day to day life. 


At the beginning of the breakup I wasn’t numb and it hurt like hell. I cried, I didn’t eat, and felt physically sick. It felt like a shock. Like 3-4 months in I started to wake up feeling completely numb, I honestly thought I was over her. It felt like dissociation. During the day my feelings would eventually come back then they would go. I would tell myself I didn’t love her anymore but my actions tell a different story. 


6 months in, I’m completely numb. It’s hard for anyone to convince me I love her. I feel this way towards my family, I don’t feel love for them but Im sure I love them because If anything happened to them I would be destroyed. I think about her all the time. I don’t miss her. I don’t love her but if something ever happens to her I don’t know what I would do.


However, I don’t want to see her with anyone else and my feelings would be hurt. I don’t want anyone because no one would compare to her, I will never replace her, I want just her. I have met other girls but I end up wanting my ex more. I hope shes okay. I’d take a bullet for her, honestly. I picture her sleeping and I smile.


See its just hard to convince myself that I still love her even though I can write out my feelings, I just can’t feel them. I feel disconnected. :( I just don’t feel in touch with myself anymore.

,depression,"To preface, I have been struggling for years now, harking back to my childhood. I basically failed my A-levels and wanted to take some time off for myself, but no, I was given the ultimatum to either apply for university or find work. I got stuck into hard drugs (specifically GHB and amphetamine) 3 years ago and that really took a toll on my serotonin and dopamine, and I have been far worse off since stopping that and going to rehab last year. I was prescribed quetiapine and that’s done nothing but made me gain weight, completely numb me emotionally, made me lose ALL motivation for my hobbies, and basically made me not want to get out of bed.

This year has been really tough. Like *really* tough. I was off work most of this year and I lost my job at the end of July. So far I have had no luck in finding new employment. I had to stop looking two months ago because I just couldn’t do it. Everyone asks me if I’m doing okay and I just give the standard ‘yes’, because I don’t know what else to say.

I’ve been on and off drinking all year. Like 1-2 week binges with a 70cL bottle of vodka a day. It’s one of the only things that makes me feel okay. I have no friends whatsoever, and when I try to talk to people, they end up blanking me or flat out leaving. I’ve given up with that now. I don’t have anyone, and I don’t want to talk to people.

To top it all off, I got into contact with my GP about a medication change to sertraline to see if that can help. I’ve tried therapy/counselling and mental health courses. They do not work. I last heard from my GP and local mental health service about their considerations of changing my medication. That was on the 3rd of November. I’ve so far got into contact with my GP twice since then, and have heard absolutely nothing.

All I want is to feel okay, find another job, and be productive again. My room is a tip, my bed is covered in random things and rubbish. I can’t be bothered. I don’t care anymore.

I guess I’m just having a bad day today. I don’t want pity. I don’t want attention. I don’t want people to tell me that everything is going to be alright. I just want to let you all know that life is fucking shit and I honestly don’t see the point in going on. No, I’m not suicidal. No, I haven’t self harmed recently. I just want to get back into taking drugs because at least is something to make life feel worth it again. Not like I even know any dealers though, so that’s a dead avenue.

,depression,"I’ve been off my meds for about a month now. I ran out of my antidepressants and was feeling good so I thought fuck it, I don’t need them. (Which was very dumb of me to think.) Since then I’ve been spiraling. I’m failing school (college student), quit both of my jobs because they became too overwhelming and I wanted to die thinking about them, I’m falling behind on bills. I can’t stop thinking about bad things. My little brother dying on Christmas last year. My grandpa who raised me is deteriorating from ALS. I have no friends and no social life. My car won’t work and I can’t afford to fix it. The list goes on.

Tonight I sit in my mom's basement tonight eating ice cream and watching youtube clips while not writing my final essay that is already late.

I have relapsed on my addiction as well as all my positive habits I have been trying to build for the last month and a half.

Since I was ten I've been in and out of therapist offices, 5 of them in total. The first two were forced and the last three I sought on my own.

My friends are all stem nerds I still know from high school, one has a job at tesla already while in school, one is about to get an internship at Lockheed, the other works in IT.

I am a virgin community college student who failed last semester and is pursuing a history degree that won't even get me a job.

I'm just tired. No matter how hard I try nothing fundamentally changes. I have been attempting different regimens and good habits for literally years. I always start out attempting to eat right, sleep before 6am, go for walks, stop procrastinating, stop watching porn, etc. This inevitably fails every single time as it did after this month.

maybe it's just the illness talking, but I am starting to think it really doesn't get better. Is life worth living if it's just an endless struggle to feel normal or good about myself?

Death 
It always resorts to death 
The thing that can ruin you 
Just by saving you 
The thing that is pain 
The thing that stops pain 

It makes you wonder 
It makes you ponder 
On whether the pain is really worth it 

But then you remember 

The people?
Your friends that will do anything 
That your death would ruin 
Your parents who think its a excuse 
That your death would ruin 

And then there are the people who
Would blame themselves 
Who would hold themselves accountable 
Those are the people who need to be held tight 
Those are proper friends

,depression,"I can see so much potential for my future but, every time something seems to go my way, I take two steps back having moved one step forward. 

Yesterday, I sent an email to my boss, entailing an ongoing issue with the workplace and how it is tearing me down. For reference, about a year and a half ago, I had to step down from my position due to lack of concentration and work a tier below that position. I took full responsibility because it was my fault. What I didn't expect was the classic work rumours passing around. It is obvious to any one who knows cash handling procedures that if you steal money, you are fired. There is no redemption. A department that handles the rides (which makes up 75% of the workplace) were the ones allegedly spreading the rumours because the food and beverage and ticketing department are aware of the protocols that in the event someone were to steal money, you are out. While the rumour was spread around, I found that less people from the rides department would talk to me, sometimes giving dirty looks. Look, I may have been paranoid and that may not have been the case, but I just knew it was obvious they were avoiding me and only talking to me when they needed to for work related reasons - I was on good terms with these people to begin with. The thing is, no one should know the reason as to why I had to step down other than my boss and management and whoever I told. 

I mentally broke and started crying hysterically to my boss the day I found out the rumours were going around. It was about a week or two from the time I stepped down. Because of this incident, all departments were spoken to about how this is a professional workplace and this is not high school. It would have been fine had it not been hypocritical of them to gossip in their own offices. A friend from management had told me that they themselves were gossiping amongst themselves and it shredded me to pieces. How can I trust them when they were laughing about it behind my back. Anyways, we had a meeting to discuss about these allegations and the managers of the rides department blatantly told me it can't be rides. Anyone with common sense can see the issue here. How could I still be here after I allegedly stole money? 

Back to the present, I had a meeting with management today in response to those issues because last week, only one person from the rides department has talked to me as if I am a worthy human being. It made me realise that it has been 1.5 years since someone had an actual conversation with me. During the meeting, they mention how does me stepping down have anything to do with the rides department avoiding me. It was the allegation and the rumours which management had 'forgotten' and had to be reminded that really upset me because it was clear to me that that's the only possible reason. It was during that time and I cannot for the life of me think of any other possible reason. Before I had to step down, I was on good terms, they acknowledged me, said hello or nodded when walking past one another. Once those rumours spread, they stopped talking to me. Maybe that was the case. Maybe I'm just a paranoid piece of shit and not worth talking to.  Either way, I shouldn't let that affect me but it did. 

It was because of my upbringing. My dad walked all over me. He was abusive which led to my oldest brother repeating the cycle. For 18 years, I felt trapped. I slept with a knife. I couldn't go to the bathroom for fear he might come for me. He knew he couldn't lay a finger on me but emotional abuse can be just as bad as physical abuse. He would torment me wherever I was in the house, banging and being destructive around me yet not laying a hand on me as evidence. It's royally messed me up that from the time when I moved out, to the present, I've never felt safe and always slept with a weapon of some sort (4 year difference). My mum enabled him and let him reign his terror. I had told her repeatedly what he was doing but nothing came of it. He was her golden child and couldn't let him suffer to learn that his behaviour is unacceptable. She gave me an ultimatum that led me to moving out - forgive your brother for the relentless torture and abuse or move out. She wasn't there for me much, only providing shelter, food and education. 

I'm writing this today because for once, I'm not letting anyone else trample all over me. I took action and put it on the record for how I am being treated. But this meeting didn't seem like a victory. Its just made me crawl back to the dark spaces in my mind. Maybe if I killed myself, maybe then all this obsession in my head can be put to bed.

,depression,"I'm almost 25 and it has become clear to me that I want to end my life.

When I was around 15, it became clear I wanted a university degree. I was an underachiever in school and my mother kept pushing me to drop out of school. She would scream and insult me when I resist. But I kept fighting back to stay in school, often involving counsellors to defend me because I felt I wouldn't be listened to if I spoke myself.

I didn't meet the requirements for university. My mother pushed me into a graphic design course I did for 6 months, then I pushed back into a university preparation course, then she pushed me into an arts degree after I completed the university preparation course, I did that for a year even though I didn't want to, then pushed back and started a Computer Science degree.

As you can see, there was no clear plan. Just two different conflicting ideals. But sadly for her, it is my life so she can fuck off and stop controlling it.

I did a year of a Computer Science degree. I consider going to university and doing a degree of my own choice the proudest thing I've ever been proud of -- because my mother made it her mission to make sure it doesn't happen. Yelling at me to give up and forget it.

The process of staying in school and going to university was a hurtful and intense experience which redefined what I want out of life, and my parent's roles in my life. It didn't happen once; it happened every year from 15 onwards until I no longer needed to rely on them. My sister believes my mother did nothing wrong and believes I'm just blaming her -- I believe she's just too blindly loyal to see any wrongdoing in my mother's behaviour.

After a year of my degree, I fell into deep depression and left university for 2 years. One year I was on the welfare, the next year I worked at a supermarket (grocery store). They didn't appreciate me there. I was honest about my struggles with mental health early on, and had issues with talking to myself in the isle. It was a tough experience.

After that, I quit and came back to university.

I have an ongoing backward-thinking habit. I don't know where it comes from, but it has existed for my whole adult life. I continually think about people, places, and memories from my past, and feel a frequent urge to search them up online to see how they are now. I feel regret at hurting others and smile at the nicer memories. I still think about YouTube personalities I used to watch at about 10 years ago who haven't uploaded videos for years.

I've seeked out EMDR because I believed it was trauma. But now I'm not sure. I don't know why I continually live in the past, but I believe it is a lifelong habit I'm stuck with.

Now I'm almost 25 in a week. I've seen many of my peers in the 4 different courses at 3 different institutions I've done graduate, I'm watching peers from high school and university have babies and get married. Every day I'm just reminded of how far away my high school years ago, and watch as peers keep moving ahead with their lives.

Even if I do graduate and get a degree, so what? I'm still going to keep looking backwards forever.

I've decided I don't want children because the inability to move on from past experiences isn't practical.

I've also had a lot of fun in my youth and it seems from here, it gets a whole lot more boring.

So I don't really see much point in being alive anymore.

,depression,"
I have had a couple of rounds of therapy (college counselling) in the past due to I’d say relatively mild depression and anxiety, and I remembered a little moment with one of my therapists that really hit me hard. I can’t remember exactly what we were talking about, something really depressing about myself, like how I feel unloveable or something like that, and she laughed to herself and then had this really guilty look on her face. She then apologised to me, and I asked what for.

She said that she’d laughed at what I said involuntarily because I have this habit of smiling and kind of laughing off whatever I’m saying whenever I’m talking about my feelings, and that she always kind of struggles not to laugh along with me and has to remind herself that I’m talking about some serious stuff, no matter how much she wants to laugh at a joke or smile back at me. She said I’ve got an infectious kind of smile though that she supposed people would just want to smile along with and not call out, as she even felt herself doing it too and she was a professional. She asked me if I noticed that I done this, but I honestly never had, at least not consciously. I have always used humour as a defence mechanism, but it’s weird to think that any time I open up to someone I actually will smile and laugh while I’m telling them how low I feel, how I feel pathetic, etc. 

I dunno, it was just weird having someone notice something like that. I’ve always felt people don’t take me seriously, and I assume that’s probably a large part of it. The fact that even when I’m being completely serious and probably feel on the verge of tears, I still have this inclination towards smiling, appearing friendly, joking around and putting people at ease. It’s like I literally don’t want people to be let in on the fact I’m a real person with actual emotions, even though I feel like a wreck, and just want to seem detached and joke about it all constantly, keeping people at arms length rather than opening up to them in any serious way.

,depression,"I'm 26, Male and i have a story to tell.
I'm writing this on 11-30-20. My birthday
Yay happy b-day to me....
Life honestly doesn't feel the same anymore and im getting closer to that numb feeling I've heard alot about. I've been a trooper my whole life. I always kept my chin up with a smile. Maybe people just wanted to see me break down?

Heres a back story about myself before i jump into why you clicked on this.

Lifes been pretty shitty. I've had my up's and great times but most of my life has been nothing but hard times. 
My grandfather owned a business and my dad worked for him. 
So you could say i lived the middle class life growing up. 
We weren't rich but my parents always treated us to stuff when we deserved it.
My problems aren't financial related.

I didn't have many friends.  
Throughout my life i maybe had 10 friends? 
It doesn't matter now because as it stands right now i only have 2 friends. 
I was bullied from the 2nd grade -7th grade. 
I was just a target to alot of kids. 
One day in the 5th grade my older brother passed away from a heart condition that runs in the family. 
Its called prolonged qt syndrome just incase you were curious.

My teacher obviously found out and she had the whole class write me ""feel better"" cards they made from the classes art supplies but my bully was also in that class. 
I'll never forget what that bully said to me the day after my brothers funeral.
He laughed at me and said ""Your brothers dead"".
I mentally snapped and blacked out.
I only remember being pulled off him by the teacher.
I was punished for it ultimately while he got away scott free because his friends lied for him.

One day in the 7th grade, i finally had enough and snapped on one of the guys who wouldn't leave me alone.
 He was walking behind me and slapped me in the back of the head for no reason at all. 
At that very moment, i already had the thought of ""I've had enough of people's shit"" running through my mind.
 Not in the school shooter type of way, but in a way i would finally stand up for myself against people who made me a target. 
So when he hit me i just let loose. 

I ended up breaking his ankle. 
He was heavy set guy. 
I'd say he was 5'4 and 320 pound easy.
i stepped on his foot with all my weight and pushed him sideways. 
Well, that landed me in hot water obviously.
 I got in way more trouble than him even though i was fighting back against a bully who did nothing but mentally and physically abuse me. 
He got to stay in school and they put me in a Behavioral Disorder school or ""BD school"" as most call it.  
I ended up dropping out my sophomore year because i was just done with life and everyones shit.

The fact that i was in trouble for doing the right thing for myself created one hell of a ride for me in the future and I'm at equal fault for the results these experiences yielded. 
I could have handled things better in life.

(So now that you have some what of a bio of myself, let me get to major points)

Around late 2011, early 2012 i ended up in my first relationship surprisingly.
 She treated me with respect, love and everything else a healthy relationship brings to the table. 
I found this to be odd at first because of how negative people have been to me.
 I grew used to this and thats where i fucked up. 
I let my guard down completely and told her why i felt misunderstood my whole life. 

I felt misunderstood because no matter what i did to defend myself or to please others i always got looked at like i did something wrong. 
Not just by my peers, but also people my age.
I felt like a total outcast my whole life.
The relationship only lasted a little under 2 years. Towards the end of that relationship i was going through another rough patch.

I found out she was cheating on me. 
I was angry, upset and didn't know why she would do that to me. 
I initially exploded verbally towards her. I could have handled myself better thinking about it now but what she did next is just cold.

I begged for her back, pleaded and poured my heart out to her over the phone. 
She laughed and handed the phone to her new toy.
(I only say new toy because she was with him for like 2 weeks lol)
The guy she was cheating with was sending me voice clips on messenger. 
I knew him, he was a Friend of a friend and i was at his house a couple times. 
Most of them consisted of him gloating about how he stole my girlfriend. 

I got to a boiling point, snapped again and went to his house without warning.
Instead of banging on the door, i kicked it repeatedly.
After the first few kicks he opens the door and i shove him back inside so i can close the door behind me. 
This way nobody could see what i was about to do to this guy.

 I beat the ever living shit out of him.
He never called the police on me either surprisingly. 
My ex made me out to be this psychopath after that but 
She was just mad that i beat up her new boyfriend.
He really did ask for it in my opinion.
the rumors she spread were pretty serious because they effect me till this day. 
She claimed without a single mark on her body to prove it, that i had beat her after i beat up the boyfriend.

I still had most of my friends. 
Me and my ex were in the same small circle so it made it a bit more tough for all of us to hang out as a group after that. They knew i only beat the shit out of him.


We skip forward to 2018 and it brings us to a similar story about another ex. The relationship starts out great, she cheats and ofcourse i wanted her back.
( im hopeless i know)
We got back together and this was just a bad idea because it just became toxic after that.
 I was no longer happy but she didn't want me to leave her.  

She went full blown psychotic and started hitting, scratching and bitting herself. I was genuinely freaked the hell out and physically picked her up and put her outside.  
Her sister came and got her and when she did i quickly put her stuff outside my front door so she couldn't get back in. 
Can you guys guess whats coming next?
She claimed i beat her and her sister not only believed her but spread it around town.

This was hit of epic proportions to my reputation because not only was my last ex part of our circle, this one was too and they both now claimed that i beat them and both of these rumors spread like wildfire after the 2nd one. 
We skip to 2020 and all of my friends are gone except for 2. 
All of them just blocked me at random times and never said a word.
Like 10+ years meant nothing.

My grandpa died from a medical procedure this year too. 
We hung out everyday. 
I would get off work about 3pm and go to his store and on my days off i would go spend time with him.
We would always talk about stuff that was on our mind.
He knew what i was going through and he was there with me every step of the way.
Now that my grandpa is gone i can feel the need to go with him becoming stronger.
It feels like life just takes what little i have left and makes it dissappear and for what? I didn't do much wrong in my life
But thats just how the cookie crumbles.

The moral of the story is don't say false things about people. It can hurt them in more ways than you realize.

I can't save myself anymore and i know how this going to end for me but maybe it will get the message out there to help stop this from happening to others....

I&amp;#39;m writing this on 11-30-20. My birthday
Yay happy b-day to me....
Life honestly doesn&amp;#39;t feel the same anymore and im getting closer to that numb feeling I&amp;#39;ve heard alot about. I&amp;#39;ve been a trooper my whole life. I always kept my chin up with a smile. Maybe people just wanted to see me break down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heres a back story about myself before i jump into why you clicked on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifes been pretty shitty. I&amp;#39;ve had my up&amp;#39;s and great times but most of my life has been nothing but hard times. 
My grandfather owned a business and my dad worked for him. 
So you could say i lived the middle class life growing up. 
We weren&amp;#39;t rich but my parents always treated us to stuff when we deserved it.
My problems aren&amp;#39;t financial related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have many friends.&lt;br/&gt;
Throughout my life i maybe had 10 friends? 
It doesn&amp;#39;t matter now because as it stands right now i only have 2 friends.

,depression,"Hi all,

Throwaway account, but I feel like i need to get this off my chest. I’ve been in a serious relationship for 6 years and one year engaged. She was happily planning a wedding for the last year, but I wasn’t in a good place. I suppose i had a bit of a depression going on since last winter.

We moved to a new country, making friends has been difficult with work and later on covid. In some sense we’ve been in isolation with the two of us. Recently she’s been making some friends via sports club, so good for her.

Problem is that since we moved here, she’s been overworked in a job she hates and been close to burnout as well.

This spring she mentioned she would’ve moved back to her homecountry if she wouldve been single, which really hurts because it made me feel i was limiting her. We’ve always been supporting each other and helping each other push further in life.
Rewind 5 weeks ago, she tells me rather out of blue (for me) that she feels unsure about the relationship and might want to continue alone. My heart sank and i hit instant depression. No motivation, no sleep, barely eating, negative thoughts all the time and just uncontrollable trembles every now and then. She’s my everything. How will i go on by myself, i moved here for her, what am i going to do with my life. All my friends live back in my home country...

One week after, I wrote a letter with all my thoughts and suggested couple counseling. She read it and tells me she doesn’t feel the same.  That evening, she breaks up with me. I havent slept properly since. Been crying on the phone with my parents, talked to some friends about it. Just fucking drama. There is no one i can hug though, second wave and all. No one to talk to face to face. She’s the one i would always turn to, but now i feel i cannot. She lacks compassion and empathy as she is in a proper depression herself and now getting free counseling because of her job. I would have to pay a shitload, which i can barely afford with the rent as i now have to pay twice as much as before.

She’s moving out next weekend, i have to stay in this hellhole for another 2 months before the rental contract is expired. I found a new place to live, but i need to seriously downsize on my stuff.

I’ve been trying to help her with packing for the upcoming move, but she now seems to have a serious temper with me. She’s just rather negative and i cannot deal with it. I don’t know what to do about this anymore. She now claims we were incompatible etc etc
I’m not sure if that is to justify her own choice or whether its always been wrong. Something i cannot believe.

Im somewhere between a permanent cry, wanting to smash things and mostly just wish i died already before i even knew about these things.
Two weeks ago when we were both in the car, the thought crossed my mind that i could maybe crash the car into a good sturdy tree. Then at least we would die together.

Today, i had to find out she’s on Tinder. Who knows for what, but the negative thoughts will always think of worst case scenario.


Tldr; the love of my life left me, i feel like i have nothing left to live for. I felt a love i never knew existed and i cannot let her go. Now I’m not sure i would ever trust anyone like that again.

&lt;p&gt;Today, i had to find out she’s on Tinder. Who knows for what, but the negative thoughts will always think of worst case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tldr; the love of my life left me, i feel like i have nothing left to live for. I felt a love i never knew existed and i cannot let her go. Now I’m not sure i would ever trust anyone like that again.
Im fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't even get horny anymore, I don't have any interest in porn... fuck. I'm turning into a substitute teacher. I think my depression is completely killing my sex drive, which sucks because sex is one of the ways I like to be affectionate and creative. Why have I lost interest? Does anybody else run into the same issues, and do you think it is related to depression? Is there anything I can do to fix this?

,depression,"The past couple of days have been a rollercoaster inside me. I've been feeling a deep ache in my chest that I've come to realize is mourning.

I regret making dreams and aspirations. It hurts all the more to realize they're not going to come true. Having to squeeze it smaller and smaller until it becomes barely a shell of what it was. 

It's ridiculous having to envision a lonely future for yourself. But I could see it. 

I hate mediocrity but that is what I am, neither too smart nor too dumb, just at the perfectly level plane of so-so. Despite knowing that I still couldn't let myself walk the line of mediocrity, because I know I'll always be plagued by thoughts of what ifs. 

But in doing so I continue to pursue a future that is well out of reach, one I can foresee will be paved by my blood, sweat and tears. 

It's daunting. It's lonely. But I couldn't quit this path because I wouldn't let me. 

I'm lazy, but I wouldn't let myself be lazy. I'm not smart, but I wouldn't allow myself to be stupid. My emotions have always been muted but I wouldn't let that stop me from showing I care. I'm not an instinctively good person, but I try to be. 

Life is hard. I wish I was a child again, where my biggest dreams were just to eat bacon and cheese pizza on the way home from school.

,depression,"Hello.

Writing here for the first time, since I feel like the return of my severe depression started ruining my personal relationships, again.

Now, I understand that it is still, of course, my fault if I don't keep my feelings in check, but I keep getting these awful, very hard to control mood swings. I don't quite know what to do with myself when I get hurt for little or no reason at all and get all sad and prickly and, at times, passive aggressive.

After one of those sudden little outbursts one of my friends basically made a point to tell me that I'm an emotional mine and I'm very hard to talk to, often, because of that. He said that he doesn't want to talk to me, at all, at times such as this and after these incidents.

The thing is, I struggle a lot right now, and having just all of my very few friends on top of that get sick of me just makes it worse, even though I totally respect their need to distance themselves from me or cut me out of their life completely. That whole conversation made me feel extremely guilty and I apologized as best as I could, though I still fucked up even in that, I think.

I also realized that I'm having suicidal thoughts again, after a long time of not having that problem.

I don't know what I'm seeking typing this now, but I just... don't know what to do and who to talk to. A therapist might be a good option, I suppose, but at this moment I don't feel like I have the strength to ask for an appointment. Everything stings and I can't bear the thought of telling about it all out loud. It feels like my whole life is crumbling around me and I don't have anyone or anything to hold on to. I am worthless and I don't think there's any point in continuing to exist as this pile of trash that nobody rightly wants to deal with. I don't want to hurt everyone around me anymore.

,depression,"
I hate who I am. I hate what I am becoming. I hate that I cannot change and I hate that my heart is not as warm as I wish it to be and my soul as light as I thought it once was.

I want to hurt myself. I want to see what once was inside stream out in meandering waves of red disdain. 

I want to be loved, and I have wished for it so for long, without realising that I cannot be loved - the person that I am is not deserving of it. I finally have come to understand that after years of lying to myself through facades and daydreams.

I am no better than the people that I judge. 

It has reached the point where I feel as though I belong in this sense of self, in this sense of life and this particular journey. As much as I have tried to climb the ragged walls that cave me in this path, I seem to slip and fall at every manoeuvre. I have come to accept this now.

What keeps me here is guilt. I envision my five year old self staring up at me with her brown eyes, such innocence and unknowing of the choices she will one day make. Of the people that she will lose, the daydreams that she will realise are simply dreams and how the world is not as kind as she hoped it would be to her.

Even now I lie. 
I am not kind. I am not loving. I am not good. 

I am manipulative. I am selfish. I am envious. I am greedy, senseless, cold and a bitch. I am a hypocrite. 

And I have tried to change but I think this is who I will always be, no matter how hard I try or how many lists I make.

,depression,"Im depressed, feeling like shit, so fuck it why not write how I feel.
I hate my fucking life, I really do.
I want to die.
I dont want to kill myself because im scared it will hurt, but, I want to be dead.
Everyday I wake up feeling ashamed, disappointed and utterly disgusted by myself, im a horrible human being and if anyone knew the truth about me they'd feel the same way.
Every waking moment I feel as if im on the verge of tears, and the verge of suicide.
Whats the point of living, honestly? 
I have two options, die, get it over with
Or
Live, a sad, pathetic and lonesome life.
People don't understand me, or how I feel nor can I explain it to them.
I was asked by my nan why im so aggressive, she asked me to stop being so serious and stay light hearted, but, its not that easy.
People make it out like it is, that you just have to do it, but I have no will.
Everyday is the same, wake up, masturbate, maybe brush teeth and wash face, read manga about some guy transporting to a different world where he's happy, feel like shit, masturbate, read, play video games, masturbate, eat, masturbate, play games, read manga, masturbate, maybe wash face and brush teeth, read manga, masturbate and sleep. Wow what an amazing life, my brains plagued with the feel of anxiety, the feeling of being easily overpowered, if only life was easy, you know, I would love to get up one day and say ""fuck this! Im gonna fight to be happy, I gonna eat healthy, get new hobbies, stop masturbating and love myself"" maybe one day I'll be transported to an a different world likes those people in the mangas I read, if only it was that simple.
Misery is all I feel apart from emptiness, I could be saying this all because im sad tonight, or I could just be speaking realistically, im sad, alone and tired, so very tired, I can only go so far, im weak, im not strong like other people, maybe (guy) was right, maybe I would amount to nothing, if only I could just move far away where the people I once knew would never come.
I was happy for a short while recently, being told (girl1) had been trying to reach me, it felt like a hand coming out the darkness, we spoke on the phone, she misses me, funny that, those words made me so happy, every time I think I hate her she says such simple shit and I feel like I love her, I cant tell if its admiration, envy or love, ironic I know. I still speak to guy1 and guy2, I miss bestguy a lot, the only friend that would stick up for me, yet, im never there when he needs me, I'm a shitty friend, guy1, guy2, guy3, guy4
No one sticks up for me, they act like they do, maybe they did at one point, but, ironically not when I needed them to, and yet I know if bestguy was there he would smack the shit outta everyone, and yet, I cant even thank him for being my friend, what a pathetic life I live, sitting on my arse writing this shit like im some fucking edgy anime character how pitiful can I get, not that it matters, (support woman) no help either, like talking to someone would help me feel whole, funny.
Im just waffling into a random document, in my head im thinking I wonder what these will think of this, wondering if I should show them, I wonder what reaction they'd give, not that it matters.
My life is going no where and everytime I fall into this pit I let my self sink with the hope one day I won't come back up and ill die a peaceful death.
Do I want to die?
I dont know, but I certainly don't want to live.
All I do is give into my selfish desires, im such a creepy weirdo, using (girl1) for far material because she said she missed me, what the fuck is wrong with me, not that that's the worst thing I've done, its just pitiful to think I'd give so much emotion to someone as if I mean fuckall to them, like I said, im tired, the same mental battle everyday, I always lose, I just want to be happy, like I mean something, maybe I just want pity, maybe I want to feel loved, maybe I want to stop being a control freak, maybe I want to sort out my short fuse, maybe I want a family that makes me feel loved, maybe I want a mother that treats me as a son, maybe I want a dad that taught me how to be a man, maybe a want a girlfriend who will hug and tell me its alright, maybe I want a life that doesn't kick me to the floor and spit on me, maybe i want to stop writing my desires on a phone at 4:37 in the fucking morning and do something that means something, im nearly sixteen and I want to show people I mean something, I dont want to be forgotten but also I want to be a normal sixteen year old, I dont want to have to do my gcses in 2022, I dont want to be alone anymore, I want people to like me, I want to like people and I want to stop being a bitch, i get called sensitive all the time, I get called lanky, I get called a rapist, I get called a nonce, I get called a sex offender, I get called a dog fucker, I get called a spotty nonce for what? Shits and giggles? Yeah funny fucking joke, have I brought this apon myself or some shit? At what point was a joke about me being a rapist funny? 3 fucking years of this shit would drive anyone mad.

I hate my fucking life, I really do.
I want to die.
I dont want to kill myself because im scared it will hurt, but, I want to be dead.
Everyday I wake up feeling ashamed, disappointed and utterly disgusted by myself, im a horrible human being and if anyone knew the truth about me they&amp;#39;d feel the same way.
Every waking moment I feel as if im on the verge of tears, and the verge of suicide.
Whats the point of living, honestly? 
I have two options, die, get it over with
Or
Live, a sad, pathetic and lonesome life.
People don&amp;#39;t understand me, or how I feel nor can I explain it to them.
I was asked by my nan why im so aggressive, she asked me to stop being so serious and stay light hearted, but, its not that easy.
People make it out like it is, that you just have to do it, but I have no will.
Everyday is the same, wake up, masturbate, maybe brush teeth and wash face, read manga about some guy transporting to a different world where he&amp;#39;s happy, feel like shit, masturbate, read, play video games, masturbate, eat, masturbate, play games, read manga, masturbate, maybe wash face and brush teeth, read manga, masturbate and sleep. Wow what an amazing life, my brains plagued with the feel of anxiety, the feeling of being easily overpowered, if only life was easy, you know, I would love to get up one day and say &amp;quot;fuck this! Im gonna fight to be happy, I gonna eat healthy, get new hobbies, stop masturbating and love myself&amp;quot; maybe one day I&amp;#39;ll be transported to an a different world likes those people in the mangas I read, if only it was that simple.
Misery is all I feel apart from emptiness, I could be saying this all because im sad tonight, or I could just be speaking realistically, im sad, alone and tired, so very tired, I can only go so far, im weak, im not strong like other people, maybe (guy) was right, maybe I would amount to nothing, if only I could just move far away where the people I once knew would never come.
I was happy for a short while recently, being told (girl1) had been trying to reach me, it felt like a hand coming out the darkness, we spoke on the phone, she misses me, funny that, those words made me so happy, every time I think I hate her she says such simple shit and I feel like I love her, I cant tell if its admiration, envy or love, ironic I know. I still speak to guy1 and guy2, I miss bestguy a lot, the only friend that would stick up for me, yet, im never there when he needs me, I&amp;#39;m a shitty friend, guy1, guy2, guy3, guy4
No one sticks up for me, they act like they do, maybe they did at one point, but, ironically not when I needed them to, and yet I know if bestguy was there he would smack the shit outta everyone, and yet, I cant even thank him for being my friend, what a pathetic life I live, sitting on my arse writing this shit like im some fucking edgy anime character how pitiful can I get, not that it matters, (support woman) no help either, like talking to someone would help me feel whole, funny.
Im just waffling into a random document, in my head im thinking I wonder what these will think of this, wondering if I should show them, I wonder what reaction they&amp;#39;d give, not that it matters.
My life is going no where and everytime I fall into this pit I let my self sink with the hope one day I won&amp;#39;t come back up and ill die a peaceful death.
Do I want to die?
I dont know, but I certainly don&amp;#39;t want to live.
All I do is give into my selfish desires, im such a creepy weirdo, using (girl1) for far material because she said she missed me, what the fuck is wrong with me, not that that&amp;#39;s the worst thing I&amp;#39;ve done, its just pitiful to think I&amp;#39;d give so much emotion to someone as if I mean fuckall to them, like I said, im tired, the same mental battle everyday, I always lose, I just want to be happy, like I mean something, maybe I just want pity, maybe I want to feel loved, maybe I want to stop being a control freak, maybe I want to sort out my short fuse, maybe I want a family that makes me feel loved, maybe I want a mother that treats me as a son, maybe I want a dad that taught me how to be a man, maybe a want a girlfriend who will hug and tell me its alright, maybe I want a life that doesn&amp;#39;t kick me to the floor and spit on me, maybe i want to stop writing my desires on a phone at 4:37 in the fucking morning and do something that means something, im nearly sixteen and I want to show people I mean something, I dont want to be forgotten but also I want to be a normal sixteen year old, I dont want to have to do my gcses in 2022, I dont want to be alone anymore, I want people to like me, I want to like people and I want to stop being a bitch, i get called sensitive all the time, I get called lanky, I get called a rapist, I get called a nonce, I get called a sex offender, I get called a dog fucker, I get called a spotty nonce for what? Shits and giggles? Yeah funny fucking joke, have I brought this apon myself or some shit? At what point was a joke about me being a rapist funny? 3 fucking years of this shit would drive anyone mad.

I’m sitting alone at a gas station 2AM and it’s kinda hitting me. I’ve been suicidal for a while on and off, but now it’s like i’ve hit the bottom. I just don’t see a point to life anymore. Days go by and everything feels hopeless. Every inch of happiness i feel just disappears like that. I can’t find the ability to feel happy for a longer period. It just ends when the day ends. Each night i’m left with a feeling of emptiness. Not trying to be all sappy here, I just don’t know who to talk to. Better to get everything out on a platform where nobody directly knows me. I haven’t talked to a professional yet and honestly idk what to say even if i do. Nothing traumatic has happened to me, nothing that explains why I don’t want to live anymore.

I feel like the only thing keeping me alive right now is that I can’t yet fathom the idea of not existing. I can’t imagine me being gone, for my family and friends. I have people that severly care about me and people that I care about, I’ve sen the way death affects people and I don’t want the people I care about to ever feel like that.

At 21 i meet my most recent ex. I am tired of telling this story but its the most harrowing thing ive been through. i thought we had something very beautiful and i was wrong. he left me feeling worse about myself than i have in a long long time.}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does the universe want me to do? I work on myself.. but I cant heal if every time i take 2 baby steps im kicked back so far. Is the cycle going to repeat? I struggle to love myself so much that i keep meeting people that abuse me and they keep pushing my progress back so that Im doomed to be hurt again? Am I really fated to never be loved because I cant love myself? Every day that I fail to love myself feels fatal, it feels like a step back on this long road towards a lovinf human relationship. Do i really not deserve one of those because of my brains response to what Ive been through?&lt;/p&gt;

Originally I wrote this long page about how I got to where I am, but no one cares. Here's the most basic, short summary I can give you: I've been depressed since \~12 because I don't feel like I belong in my own body or my own brain. Because I was depressed, I did morally atrocious things online when I was \~14. Years later now that I turned 18, I try to finally get my life back on track. Months after I try that, police raid my house due to what I did when I was 14. I try to kill myself because of the shame but end up in a hospital for two weeks, and in-patient psychiatric care for a week after that. I go home and continue therapy completely online, this time on medication. 

My life has never been this low. Six years of being depressed and hating every aspect of myself and only now am I at my lowest point.

I feel terrible, I haven&amp;#39;t felt this bad in a long time. I&amp;#39;ve been struggling for so long, and at this point I really do just wanna end it, or fucking at least get admitted somewhere so I don&amp;#39;t have to deal with everything all at once anymore.

,depression,"I'm feeling down and/or angst and/or sadness (lets call this my “down” state) most days. Today is my best feeling day in around a week, yet I am barley feeling “OK”.

What seems to be the smallest stressor (which when considered pragmatically should not even be a stressor) seems to trigger my mood from a what is a constant ""meh"" to the “down” state and often lasts for days at a time. Severity comes in waves throughout the day.

I don’t feel like there is a reason to feel this way. I have a really good job and a stable home life with 2 great (albeit challenging/full on) kids and a great wife. Health is otherwise OK.

Communication with my wife could be better, as I haven’t been able to talk to her about how I feel emotionally. I really struggle to open up to ANYONE. We otherwise treat each other with love and respect. She knows I’m struggling to point, but I don’t think she understand just how badly.

While the “pressure” of my job seems to trigger my “down” state more than anything, in reality it is a very easy-going job, with completely reasonable expectations and more than enough time to complete the work I’m given. Which leads to one of my biggest problems – focus. I really struggle to stay interested and focused on a specific task or project, unless I find it particularly interesting or technically challenging. This has led me to having issues getting through my work load, triggering my “down” state frequently. “Focus” has been a problem for a few years, but especially worse since COVID has me working from home most days.

It’s not just work. Other things seem to trigger me and get me really down. Earlier this year we did some renovations and the small little elements of stress surrounding that caused the same problems. As do some social situation or times where I’m worried about being judged.

The thought of even talking to a doctor about any of this has me jittery.

Some days I feel a bit better than “OK” and convince myself everything is fine and to just keep pushing through it alone. Then it all cycles through again.

I can’t remember a time in the last few years feeling really happy or joyed about anything, apart from a handful of moments lasting a no more than few minutes, usually seeing one of my kids especially happy or hitting a milestone. Things/hobbies that once interest me don’t really excite me anymore. Although that could just be the reality of not having time for those things with a young family.

,depression,"For the first month and a half of lamotrigine, I felt better. So much better.

However for the pas 2 months it's be bad, so very bad. I'm getting constant thoughts of suicide, and it's weird. I've gotten them before but these feel more real and more persuasive. I'm so much more emotionally unstable. I'm not CONSTANTLY depressed like I was but now I'm so prone to these meltdowns. I'm seeing it deep into my life now, and once again, it's becoming a routine.

I've lied to him and told him it's fine for two months. Only every listing minor things like ""a bit emotional but not a lot"" I'm at 150mg, started at 25mg. I was diagnosed with depression but I guess he believes I had a mood disorder. I'm rambling now I'm sorry.

My point is. What do I do. How do I tell him it's not working, I recently got prescribed adderall as well and I don't want him thinking that's the issue because this has been longer than that..

I'm confused.

,depression,"Here it is. The day I've been dreading. I never thought after fighting for 8 years that I would be voluntarily 5150ing myself in order to seek help. 

Truth is. Im in a very dark place, and its hard to talk to my family and friends about it because It's hard to explain something about me to someone when I don't fully understand it myself. On top of the confusion I have with my emotions I have a problem with articulating sentences verbally and I think its caused as I'm an introvert. I sometimes think I have a communication disorder because I can write perfectly fine as I'm sure you've noticed already, Sometimes now becoming more often i have noticed an improvement with my speech, the communication disorder only comes out when im nervous, talking to strangers or people im not fully comfortable around, and when I speak about a topic im not really familiar with.

Back on track. 
I'm not looking forward to it because I'm going in an environment where I'm locked down in an unfamiliar place for possibly 3 days. If that won't flare ones anxiety and depression then I don't know what will.
On the other hand, I am looking forward to it to seek the proper help I need to better my life. 

I'm depressed most of the time, especially at nights.
I would fall into a deep pit of loneliness and pure sadness. If I'm gonna be honest,  I don't know what went wrong and I've been trying hard to figure it out for 3 years now. I often have passive aggressive suicidal thoughts, I don't actually want to kill myself but the thoughts stick around. I wouldn't hurt myself in anyway as I don't actually want to die. I just want to find the old me again. The old happy go lucky kid with a will to do anything again..

But thinking about something such as these suicidal thoughts is mentally draining, It takes hours for me to get out of bed some days. The thing that hurts the most is thinking of the aftermath. My final moments, the pain I will cause to my loved ones, I would end up leaving them with questions they'll never know the answer to, and guilt they'll have to live with for the rest of their lives..

I'm falling apart, I don't recognize myself anymore and nobody recognizes me from the person I once was just a few years ago.. I've lost all motivation to do anything, my life is at a standstill due to me not being productive. I should have graduated this year but I have somewhere around 90 credits left because I've just given up on absolutely everything. I have a car sitting in my moms driveway waiting for me to get a license but I just don't want to do anything about it. I think I might be going through a burnout with life. 

I've lost the joy in everything, I've been subconsciously pushing my friends away to where inhardly talk to them, basically alienating myself from everyone. Everybody has tried helping me, my mom, dad, my dads gf and her family, and many others but I just don't accept it. I push them away too and basically said screw you to everyone without meaning too because I would get angry at them because of stress and depression..they slowly stopped helping less and less because they have been bending over backwards for me only for me not to accept it because I don't know how..

I dont know where to begin. im overwhelmed with confusion, self hatred, and loneliness..I've given up the fight to try and better myself and now let my demons do whatever they want to me and I'll just take it. My mom and dad told me they hadn't given up on me and I believe it, its just that they don't know how to help me anymore because my depression has progression gotten worse throughout the years. 
I have a dying hobby that I once had a lot of fun with.
Most of my model planes are dust collectors. Spending more time in a garage then flying in the air, I walk past some of them all the time and it makes me sad seeing them rotting away because I've lost joy in it as I have no money to fuel it.

I don't believe that the opposite of depression is happiness, instead I think its vitality and vitality is something that i have lost. Everything seems like its too much work to do now.. making food, taking a shower (yes I still shower), getting up in the morning to go do something productive even when I know that it will benefit me, and many other things that I can't think of off the top of my head. Medication helps with the loss of Vitality. I see more good days where I am a little more productive but I never have truly gotten my motivation back, I am not always on my meds though which is something I am going to be working on as I have a really bad memory. I need to start setting alarms.

I think it might be important to note that a few years ago when I was 14. I was taken advantage of by one of my family members by marriage it happened twice and I eventually cut ties with him and waited quite some time to tell someone. During that time I was burying it in the back of my mind and I've kept burying and burying to where I hardly remember what exactly happened. My biggest regret is waiting  to tell someone because when the authorities were finally involved I couldn't provide any evidence but managed to remember just enough of what happened to keep my story the same. By then during that time the family member sold his truck so it couldn't be traced to him and I was dumb enough to delete the messages because I was didn't want it in my life. He got away. 

Everyone who knows agrees that it might be a root of my problems as I have not dealt with it yet as I've only buried it.

I am hoping to go to this place to receive professional help that will hopefully better me but I'm anxious about it.

,depression,"This difficult to write, but I wanted to get it off my chest. 

I have severe clinical depression and anxiety - I’ve been on different combos of medication since I was 14, nothing working. 

I’m 37, I have no friends, no family, and no caring in my life. I’ve not had any physical contact with another person in 15 years. 

I’m about a 2/10 - im not creepy or disfigured, but I’m morbidly obese, bald and I’m not good looking. I’m not an Incel though, I totally don’t think it’s anyone else’s fault I’m alone. 

People seem to like me, but don’t invite me to spend time together, or accept my invitations.

The solitude is crippling. I listen to comedy podcasts almost on a loop, and the happiness is a distraction from the silence and a window into a happy world. But that window is often a terrible reminder of what I don’t have.

&lt;p&gt;I have severe clinical depression and anxiety - I’ve been on different combos of medication since I was 14, nothing working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 37, I have no friends, no family, and no caring in my life. I’ve not had any physical contact with another person in 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m about a 2/10 - im not creepy or disfigured, but I’m morbidly obese, bald and I’m not good looking. I’m not an Incel though, I totally don’t think it’s anyone else’s fault I’m alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People seem to like me, but don’t invite me to spend time together, or accept my invitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solitude is crippling. I listen to comedy podcasts almost on a loop, and the happiness is a distraction from the silence and a window into a happy world. But that window is often a terrible reminder of what I don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I am quarantined in Los Angeles, and the experience has been miserable to say the least. At first it was kind of fun, I was going on long distance runs, getting creative, and having the longest break from working I've ever had in my life. I am naturally a very motivated person, always working out, always on the go. My year had started off great. Everything I spent years working my ass off for was finally coming to fruition. Career-wise, fitness wise, life wise in general, I finally felt like opportunities were just pouring in. 

At first it was nice to slow down. Plus we had enough unemployment money at the time to actually pay our bills. Then a lot of my friends moved out of town unfortunately, so I didn't have anyone to go on socially distant runs or walks with. I spent a lot of the summer protesting (safely, with masks, please don't shame), and getting tear gassed and shot for nothing by police. I think the overstimulation and watching horrific things constantly on socials or experiencing them in real time for months on end really traumatized me. Also watching some fellow protestors lose their minds a bit- lose themselves (understandably), and having to process awful news daily. I think the last protest I went to was in September and it was so brutal I can't. 

Unfortunately instagram and other socials were the only real way to share information to keep each other safe. I never posted anything insane but I know people started to look to me for protest coverage and insight. It was hard to see a lot of people watch my stories, know I got tear gassed and not even ask a simple ""Are you okay?"" Or watch people just stay silent in general about everything that was happening. I eventually deleted my instagram and my OCD and depression constantly have me wondering if people thought I lost my mind for speaking out so loudly. The thing is I've always been this person, I've always protested, I've always worked within the community, I just never used socials in this way. I never really used socials much at all. But to some extent- I don't think people understand what a dystopian nightmare LA has become.  

Anyways, this is a bit of a ramble. I am at this point where I am so so depressed. Because of my OCD I wonder if people legitimately think my posts or stories were insane. Which is silly, because I will never regret standing up for what's right. And I also know that having OCD makes me consistently edit and overthink almost everything I put on social media before I do it, but as anyone with OCD knows- logic tends to take the passenger seat to the obsession, because I know I would defend everything I put out there if confronted. 

But moreover, I feel like at this point I have no purpose. I spend so much of my week getting up, working out, maybe going on a walk or a run. Then there will be these days when I can barely move, or I drink a whole bottle of wine and smoke cigarettes. Going from moving so much and always being on the go pre-quarantine-, to not- and drinking more than I normally would- I've gained 15 pounds. I feel horrible about everything. I feel hopeless about the future. I don't have a close family. I didn't get my unemployment last week (which is barely anything anyways). I'm afraid of my car getting repoed and the unbelievable amount of debt I'm going to be in when this is over. I had to stop going to therapy because I couldn't afford it. It just feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. 

I'm new to reddit and I told my brother about getting on it. He suggested this might be a good place to find friends or find a community. I just honestly feel really really alone. Most of my guy friends who are still out here seem to have ulterior motives (i.e. want to get in my pants). My best girl friend moved away and I'm realizing that a lot of the people I considered friends in the first place were really just social acquaintances. Today all I've done is gotten a coffee, showered, and laid on the couch feeling like crying- mostly knowing I can do it because my roommate is out of town.

I always make things work, I'm always glass half full. But I feel like it's so hard anymore and I can't understand how to get back to that. I reach out to friends often to go on walks or runs on nature trails and it's like pulling teeth to get a response. I wish I had someone, anyone who would do the same for me. 

I have been looking for jobs out of the country, but it's hard to even find the motivation to punch up my resume. I know this whole thing was very rambly, but my mind feels like a mess today. I feel like I just need to know there's others who are feeling this way. Maybe there are people in LA who want to go on a hike or work on something creative together?  I just feel so terribly alone.

,depression,"TW: self harm 


My partner has been in a behavioral hospital for the past four days. They are struggling with OCD that has gotten a lot worse since the pandemic. They aren’t suicidal and they don’t self harm, but there OCD has never been this bad. They can’t eat or sleep they are so anxious. We haven’t actually seen each other in person in a month because they are so afraid of getting sick. While this is somewhat valid since there’s a pandemic, they are taking it to the extreme. They started wearing a mask around their family who they live with, even though none of them are high risk. They tried to get me and their family to wear masks around each other at all times too. They even asked me to quit my business so we could go to his families summer home to isolate until a vaccine comes out. Obviously I can’t quit my job, I have bills to pay and need to feed myself somehow. I have done everything I can to be there for my partner, though there’s only so much I can really do. 

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, and it’s been very bad in the last few months since my business is struggling and I can’t seem to recover. That paired with not being able to see my partner who I’ve been worrying about 24/7 has been rough. I want to be there for them through this hard time in their life, but I’m finding it hard because I’m so emotional right now. My partner is usually the one who is there for me when I am going though a rough patch, but now they have to focus on themselves so Ive lost them as a part of my support system. 

It feels like nothing good has happened is such a long time and things keep getting worse and worse. It’s becoming too much for me to handle. I have a history of self harm, I punch my thighs repeatedly and sometimes my head. Tonight I was triggered by a conversation I had with my partner. I was trying to support them while they were panicking in the hospital, and I became overwhelmed and started venting to them. They didn’t respond to anything I said and I got upset because it felt like they didn’t care. I punched myself repeatedly on my thighs and got extremely close to cutting myself which is something I’ve never done, mostly because I’m squeamish. 

I just don’t know how to deal with all of this anymore. I’m trying my best to get more business, but at this point I’m looking into getting a part time job since I’m not making much progress and I need the money. My partner is hurting and I feel like I’m being a horrible partner to them because I keep making everything about me and my depression instead of putting my problems aside so I can be supportive of them while they are in a behavioral hospital. I know they are struggling and don’t have the time to think about me and my problems, but I keep getting upset anyways when they don’t acknowledge me or my feelings. I almost feel like they would be better off without me in their life, I’m so selfish and negative all the time. I’m just a hindrance to the progress they are trying to make to become better...

,depression,"Hi all, I wish you have a better day than usual. It's yet another thread seeking advice regarding reaching out again, but I can't really see any thread that has similar situations to mine so any advice would be appreciated. Sorry if anything I'm saying is confusing, or offending. I try my best as English secondary speaker. I appreciate your patience. 

Tldr: dad was abusive, now he's a better person and we have a fair relationship. Want to reconcile and request his support as a step for my mental health. Don't know if asking to reflect the past together, is a selfish act. 

--- 

Background 

I've had chronic depression and anxiety for 12 years now, had three attempts. Since my second attempt I've been hospitalised and formally diagnosed with MDD and MAD around 4 years ago. I am on and off with professional help, but currently I'm keeping with my medication and psychotherapy. 

I have good relationship with my mom, which prevented me from doing the first attempt. She knows about my condition, but not my two little sisters nor my father. I have good relationship with my sisters, but I don't want to burden them with this information and make them feel bad for their big bro. 

My father on other hand, was extremely harsh when I was young. I want to believe that I have forgiven him for making me who I am right now, but still I cannot shake that thought. My feeling say forgive, my thoughts says the past cannot be changed and he was a bad parent. 

We have uhhh, a currently fair relationship. He have changed, even though he still speak like a big mouthed cunt, his action have changed to a better father and even owed his mistakes to me. We have significantly different political view, but we respect each other. His support made me land my dream career which require a lot of financial support. I can genuinely say I love him directly and he said to me back, but in the past he was violent and we had fist fights and shed our blood on each other's. I fought him because I reached a breaking point of being physically abused. Shouted, slapped, whipped, knife directed at me. 

I learned to use my fist and my teeth to defend myself in school learning from him. Even with short stature, it was not courage, but a blood-lust that made looking to fight my bullies every Friday during elementary school (mind you I'm in different country. I seldomly experience any direct consequence). Eventually innocent schoolmates were involved. I always justify that I am defending myself, but at certain point I've become the bully. Growing up I despise that phase and ran to different school for fresh start, but I'm still struggling to get past that even today. A part of my condition is having relational commitment issues, one being of amplified fear of harming anyone that cared about me. 

When my father asked my forgiveness for being abusive, he justified that my grandpa did it to my father too. 

My father is not only a subject of my condition, but I think this is the more relevant point of discussion.

---

Additional information

I have daily suicidal thoughts which circles around my past, and the fear of becoming a harming again. I have my way out ready within my reach. However, I'm always reminded about my little sisters as reason to live. 

I don't have any lasting friends because I have a tendency to burn bridges. I had a group of good friends, which I left because I slipped out about my condition from being *subconscious* drunk. I maintain a facade and don't want others to feel responsible for me. 

I never fought since high school, except from a mutual road rage in my adulthood.. Which shamefully I enjoyed. 

---

Discussion

But in the end, I think I need to be honest to others, I need to accept that I cannot do this by myself. My mental problems emerge from me making own assumptions and conclusion, which frequently led to self destructive reasoning. And I'm thinking if opening up to my father, would be a process of reconciliation (?) 

My mom is pretty adamant that I should not open up to him. It seems that my father also have mental issues, and she doesn't want us to be both unstable. He's working in a job with high suicide rate. 

I just want my inner circle to be unbroken. It's been an arduous and too long of a process. I don't like to blame anyone except myself, but at this point I need to be honest to myself that there are external things that made me like this. My struggle is knowing how to be at peace with that. 

So my questions are: should I be honest to my father about my condition? Should I even tell him that his past parenting contributes to my condition? Would that worsen our relationship? Am I selfish to tell him that? Should I continue keeping my silence and work it out myself? 

Maybe tangent: should I barge in unsolicited to the lives I've harmed, and say my regrets for being a violent child? If you were bullied, would you forgive me if I say that I deserved the constant suffering (karma if you believe so) due to my actions against you?

,depression,"TW//Mention of SH

I worked at Legoland for a 3rd party company until March 16th when we closed indefinitely. I went without a job but was lucky enough to qualify for FL's unemployment and I was fine. 

I started working from home with an insurance company on July 6th and while I was training, I thought that I had found something that I could do for life. Then they let us get on the phones with actual customers and my anxiety and intrusive thoughts kicked into overdrive. I started having frequent anxiety attacks and I was hyperventilating after every rocky call. I sounded fine (according to my managers and my mother who could hear me from the living room) but I couldn't focus and I was constantly going over in break time because I couldn't calm down from my anxiety attack. Then around the beginning of September I started missing work. I would wake up exhausted and once I sat at my desk, the thoughts started. It was getting so bad that I had seriously considered self-harm which at that point I had been clean from for just over a year. I got terminated from that job in October when I couldn't produce a doctor's note diagnosing me with anxiety (I've never been able to afford therapy or a Dr's visit). 

My mother, who has never understood mental illness, took it terribly and eventually it lead to me writing a 4-page long note to her, explaining my depression and anxiety and telling her why it was so hard for me to work there. She tried to understand, but I can tell the bottom line is that I need to grow up and stop letting depression hold me back from getting a job. She still doesn't get it.

End of October I started work as a substitute teacher. I would pick the grade and school and I was totally in control of when and how I worked. I realize now that this was a TERRIBLE idea for me. I feel pathetic saying this but I've only worked ONE day as a substitute teacher. It was a great day, don't get me wrong. But I can't physically make myself do it again. I don't know if anyone understands what I mean by that but it's like all I can tell myself is that it doesn't matter what I do because I'm going to fuck it up eventually just like I always do.

I joke around with my online friends and tell them how depressed I am (omg quirky) but I can't cope and nothing that I did before is helping me anymore. The person I used to call my best friend is slowly distancing herself from me and realized that she thought that I was ""fake"". I found out, thanks to supportive and kind friends, that she was toxic and a bad person for me. 

I haven't made car payments in months. I can't make my car insurance payment from November and I'm lucky enough they let me postpone it another 15 days. But I can't find another job. I apply everywhere and hear nothing back. I'm only 19 so I obviously don't have much experience but I figured since I have a college degree I'd at least have some sort of an upper hand. I graduated from high school and college in 2019. They told me that I'd get a great job with my AA and that it could help me get closer to my bachelor's. But I feel hopeless and I feel like a disappointment. I'm turning 20 in less than 3 days and all I feel like I've wasted my life. I haven't done anything with my education and I can't get out of this stupid pit I'm in. My mother still doesn't understand and she just sees me as lazy and unwilling to try and work. But I can't afford to get out of here and I can't afford to lose my car.

I'm self-destructive and I can't express how much it hurts to go from ""such a smart young lady"" to ""a depressed child"". I feel like the people in my life are only tolerating me until I finally get the hint and just remove myself from their lives. I haven't ranted to them because I'm supposed to be the strong one. I help other people so I don't have to think about myself but I can't do this anymore. I'm 0 days clean. I need therapy or meds or something. I miss being able to distract myself from toxic thoughts and I miss being happy. I feel like such a fuckup. 

I doubt anyone will read this and even if they do I doubt they'll get this far. But if you do, thank you for listening. And also sorry you had to listen.

&lt;p&gt;I worked at Legoland for a 3rd party company until March 16th when we closed indefinitely. I went without a job but was lucky enough to qualify for FL&amp;#39;s unemployment and I was fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working from home with an insurance company on July 6th and while I was training, I thought that I had found something that I could do for life. Then they let us get on the phones with actual customers and my anxiety and intrusive thoughts kicked into overdrive. I started having frequent anxiety attacks and I was hyperventilating after every rocky call. I sounded fine (according to my managers and my mother who could hear me from the living room) but I couldn&amp;#39;t focus and I was constantly going over in break time because I couldn&amp;#39;t calm down from my anxiety attack. Then around the beginning of September I started missing work. I would wake up exhausted and once I sat at my desk, the thoughts started. It was getting so bad that I had seriously considered self-harm which at that point I had been clean from for just over a year.

My mom died this month. She was in Hospice in my home. She live with me a few years before she passed. Last year in November she was sick and hospitalized. They intubated her. She was there for about 3 weeks. I thought I lost her. 

She came home but was basically bed ridden for the last year of her life. 

I was mean to her right before she died. She kept moaning and I hadn't slept for weeks and I yelled at her asking her what she needed. I had been hand feeding her and caring for her around the clock alone. Every time I would fall asleep she would call for me or moan loud enough to wake me. I hadn't  slept in days...After that she became silent and didn't or couldn't communicate for almost 3 days before she passed. 

In June I lost my dog who was 17 years old. I rescued him from and abusive home when he was 6 months old. No matter how much love he had, he died never wanting to look you in the eye. He was my 55 pound lap dog and the best animal I ever had. When he was close to the end he could barely stand and I syringe fed him and gave him fluids.

In March I lost my cat who was 10. He threw a blood clot which was something I had never heard of before. He screamed and howled in pain for an hour and died in the car on the way to the emergency vet.

My Grandfather died July 2nd 2018. He was my person. My mother had a breakdown after I was born and at 6 months old I was thrown into his arms and he took care of me. We bonded. So much so that he carried me on his arm so much and so long he tore ligaments and had to have surgery. I clearly recall being 4 and him telling me he couldn't carry me any longer and the fit that transpired. 

I had moved away and had a life but when he became ill I moved 1500 miles back home to care for him. I did it for 4 years while working full time and raising my child. As soon as I started receiving financial aid for caring for him my Aunt swooped in, forced me out and I never saw him again. He died 8 months later. 

My son spoke to him on his birthday a month before he died and he used a key word we had. He said ""Pa is surrounded by all these women, but I'd rather be with you kids. Know papa loves you.""

I am sooo sad and broken. My entire foundation is gone. My son is 18. I know I have to be his rock. His home. But I am so, so, so sad. I don't know how to keep going.

,depression,"Too long to read sorry

 I am a 20 year old girl living with my parents and 3 siblings and sis in law in Nyc. I am currently a full time student at CUNY and I have always been financially dependent on my father. I was spoiled and treated like a princess durinf my childhood days( they dont know abt the trauma i endured when i was a child i still keep it a secret bc ik my parents will not act rationally)I don't currently work because my parents do not permit me to do so. I do need permission to go outside, they limit me on how long i can be out for, who am i working with, im not allowed to work in fast food or retail, office job is fine as long as i come home before sun sets. Im not allowed to wear the clothes i feel comfortable in even tho they are not anywhere near unmodest. Even in my own house i am expected to dress modestly. (No skin, no tight clothes, not too loose) They limit my means to earn and so I don't have but much saved up. I cannot up and leave my family as they are very susceptible to the backlash they probably will face if I just leave. I can find refuge in fam members houses but i will be found if i go to those places and my parents will force me back home and they will start problems with them. I can remove myself and end up in a domestic violence shelter but i dont want to put myself at risk for covid and im not even escaping any imminent physical harm, but its a likely possibility w them. Im confident i can take care if myself because i take care of my family. I prioritize my fam. Mt oarenrs believe women are infefior to men and must rely on a man. They see my emotional sensitivity as weakness. Every mistake i have made is held on to forever. (Mistakes that are not even mistakes like gettinf a piercing without their permission when i was 19. MY MOM HAS THE SAME PIERCING) my mom is diff from my dad but not really. She was a child bride and the processing of her trauma is evident in her behavior and speech. For example she ignored me for 11 days once bc i went outside to get dinner w some friends. I hadnt been outside in 3 weeks. I was not posing a risk but she was upset bc my dad allowed me to go. The anger is misplaced whatever) Even before the pandemic, I had a normal life of a muslim bengali girl, even better than most daughters that deal with similar situations.but my parents have made the decision to get me married even before I have completed my studies. I have the option to say no, however, I'm also told that I am not allowed to be independent until i am married. Im explicity told im being taken care of till marriage. They will not accept someone that doesnt adhere to their liking, and they like no one. (Seriously)Literally dont like anyone. They srranged my brothers marriage to my first cousin. (Diff story) they wont force me to marry my cousin dw but they will be so particular and they are not happy with anyone elses choices. If i refuse their choice they will feel insulted, they will twist things to make it seem like i am trying to go against their wishes (accuse me of straying from Islam, having a secret bf) they will guilt trip me. It so sad bc i am expected to smile when i see them and look so happy but everytime i see them i want to cry. They dont care about how we feel boo hoo.There are many things I can do , like just leave and depend on myself. Give in and be unhappy. Fight back and see the consequences of my actions. If i go against their wishes, I don't know the consequences. It can be violent as my parents have put their hands on me. (rare) They scream, humiliate, manipulate, gaslight me and my older sibling. They take their anger out on other ppl and we have to let them .They forces us to be dependent on them so if we dont listen to them, we have no means to support ourselves. Yes, my job is to finish my education and look for a job. Work, save your money, and leave. This is what I am trying to accomplish. I dont want to be like them.My mental health has been deteriorating for years and i have been receiving medication and counseling for as a treatment plan however, I still deal with this interpersonal violence and have to continue to endure it till my parents arrange my marriage to someone of their standards. I take antidepressants just to control mt emotions because i would not be able to get out of bes sometimes or focus on anything without crying in between. My main goal to reach the means to support myself and have some slace. I have had job offers that my parents have left me no choice to decline. (he took me out of the country). My parents have found out that i have some money saved up and now they expect me to contribute to household expenses while i dont hold a job. Im not allowed to be independent but im doing things that independent adults are doing for themselves. This makes it hard for me to accumulate money without having a steady income. Though they are not against my education, but they have very less interest in my studies and they have planned my life out for me and I'm to follow. They let me study whatever because they know that i will end up with a man that will support me financially etc. that may sound less awful but i like someone and my parents will never accept him. (This is important but not rn)My older brother who is married and has dealt with this situation but didnt fight back advised me to find someone of my liking (must be Muslim, preferably bengali unless i want to deal with even more drama)and find him soon unless i want to stay and deal with my parents and taking care of children and house responsibilities and remote schooling which they always neglect to give me an environment to study. My sis in laws housework can almost be considered a 9-5 in return she lives as a family member and is provided for. When she has the baby, i know i will be expected to care for the child bc my parents wont allow a break from her responsibilities. ( she has HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDAUM AND MY PARENTS THINK ITS LAZINESS LOL)I schedule take everyone to all their appointments, everyones. All 6 other members of my family. My youngest little brother has FOP disease and its so hard for me to see him be so miserable in his own home. My other little brother has a learning disability that my parents misunderstand for misbehaving and just being immature and lazy. In my own room, its hard to study when i cant even read a paragraph because everyone in the house is screaminf. I have to turn off my camera and mic because ppl will suddenly come in ans out and scream and it could sound very concerning. Its so hard to explain to my professors how much this is taking a toll on me.Idk how to focus when my parents pull me out class or my work to do things for them. Ofc i have tried to set boundaries but they gaslight me into making me feel like i dont do enough for the family. I have been coparenting my mother in raising two young kids since i was 11. Ive been completing all the paperwork that goes on in the house, whethere its expecting to pay bills on time for my father, expecting to help my pregnant sis in law because she doesnt know english. I am fully responsible for my two younger brothers education and health.  Sometime i find them making me help someone else (outside the fam)bc my father promised them i would do this for them, without even asking me. I do most of the communication for my father and im expected to do these. If i dont then i am an ungrateful. That i dont prioritize them. They guilt trip us.  And i have never said no. I dont speak back bc then they will punish me. It quite possibly can get physical but its usually them screaming their lungs out, insulting me, They have me in psychological chains. No, there is not much physical abuse I am to escape them, but everyday gets harder and harder for me to continue. I'm limited in what I can do. I have a physically disabled sibling, another younger sibling, a pregnant sister in law that is also forced to depend of my parents, and my older brother, who is also in the same position but he works with my father. My responsibilities as the daughter is to follow my mother and sis in law in their routine which is fine with me. But they have always tried to keep me inside the house and away from other people, including other family members, friends etc since adolescence . I'm not allowed outside the house for more than an hour a day, even when i have responsibilities. If i am away for even one hour, not a second goes by before they begin to call me phone and demand i leave whatever im doing and come home. If i dont i can expect a period of yelling, stern lecturing, and they restrict me even more. It has been difficult trying to balance school, complete training, trying to find work, taking care of my family fulltime aswell, and maintaining my mental health. Yes, I get there are strategies to deal with these kinds of situations however, I see very little hope in the ability to live an independent life. If i dont follow my parents instructions, i will be left alone and will be left to support myself. This pandemic has heightened all the stress and intensity and leaves me in a sulken depressed state. No amount of medicine or therapy will help me escape this situation. I have to be there for my siblings and my sister in law. The gender based violence may not always be physical, but everyone in my home is miserable. To have our own parents twist our arm till we give in. I am feeling so hurt writing this and i don't know where to go or what to do. If my parents introduce me to a potential suitor(s), i will be expected to choose now or delay until i have finish my studies. Regardless, there is not sign of willingness to allow me, their only daughter, make a decision for myself. Never happened, never will happen under his roof. what can i do? Should i complete my studies and find a job and leave. This will lead them to possibly disowning me. May forbid me to see my family members that rely on my support, maybe not moneywise but theres no one in the house to advocate for my younger siblings that need diff type of attention and environment that they are not receiving. My sis in law has always fallen to being the housewife and is expected to do her daily chores and cook and clean ans maintain the house and the family.  She has never worked and is discouraged from pursuing education and now she is pregnant with no means to support herself and her baby unless its relying on my brother who ultimately also depends on the money my father gives him. I am discouraged from working bc it takes me away from the home and taking care of the family and its not “necessary” since my parsnts provide for me but they dont really care that i have to work, to build my resume, to enhance my education, to financially provide for myself. They say i can work online and i have been having such a hard time finding s remote jobs with the qualifications i have which is not many. I decided i will pay for medical assistant classes so that i can be certified and have some help finding jobs, even so, i dont know if my parents will ultimately work after I completed. They expect me to finish the classes but they are telling me i cant go to work in a hospital. Ofc I understand the risk of bringing home Covid19, but this is what is masking their actual reason is that they dont want me to earn. Women are to take care of the household and they can work if they want to but as long as it doesnt come between her “responsibilities”. This is so maddening. They are not only like this to me and my siblings but everyone in our family including their siblings, their siblings families, cousins etc. everyone is always left quiet bc whenever anyone stands up to my parents, my parents will bash them, humiliate, if they can maybe even slap them. They will always put them in their place which they believe is at their feet. And its sad to say that i will have to continue living like this because i am to follow my religion in this household and my religion tells me that i must obey my parents. Yeah it also says u cant trwat ppl like shit but like i said, my parents will never let someone speak over them about anything. Sorry i dont want to read this over snd skim for mistakes but im grateful for the house i live in, the food i eat, my loving siblings, i love my parents snd they love me. But we will never be on the same page because they don’t respect anyone but expect to be treated like royalty. Im not even asking for advice but i am always labelled as dramatic but this is my life.

,depression,"So I have had a lot of debates on myself when it comes to my mental health and I almost feel like I have no idea where to categorize myself. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but always felt like something was missing. 

I grew up around a lot of chaos, not in my immediate family but with cousins/aunt/uncles. Lost a lot of very dear and influential family members in my childhood and was bullied to the point of self harm in the sixth grade. I was more of an outcast in my early teens, and in high school my parents divorced. 

My dad was never really involved and things took a turn when my mom left and my sister ( who was 22 ) decided to stay living with my dad. Over the course of three years, my dad became mentally abusive, rude, explosive, my sister moved out and I pretty much dropped out of school. We never had food in the house and I ended up telling him one morning that I was leaving, because I had bad suicidal thoughts the night prior. 

My mom and I have worked our asses off but we have struggled a lot the last year and I feel like my mental health has taken a turn and I'm starting to really think about things. 

I have panic attacks weekly, nightmares since I was a kid, sometimes cry/breakdown and have conversations with myself out loud, sometimes almost as if I'm working things out w someone. Speaking in front of people on my own gives me mouth and body twitches and I always feel exhausted. I have really bad mood swings and am really self conscious to the point where most days it consumes me. It feels like my head and thoughts don't stop from the moment I wake up till I fall asleep. I just feel so lost, especially with myself.

Pretty much open to any opinions or insight on this, as my family and doctor have struggled with it and is always considered regular anxiety/depression.

I was more of an outcast in my early teens, and in high school my parents divorced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad was never really involved and things took a turn when my mom left and my sister ( who was 22 ) decided to stay living with my dad. Over the course of three years, my dad became mentally abusive, rude, explosive, my sister moved out and I pretty much dropped out of school. We never had food in the house and I ended up telling him one morning that I was leaving, because I had bad suicidal thoughts the night prior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom and I have worked our asses off but we have struggled a lot the last year and I feel like my mental health has taken a turn and I&amp;#39;m starting to really think about things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have panic attacks weekly, nightmares since I was a kid, sometimes cry/breakdown and have conversations with myself out loud, sometimes almost as if I&amp;#39;m working things out w someone. Speaking in front of people on my own gives me mouth and body twitches and I always feel exhausted. I have really bad mood swings and am really self conscious to the point where most days it consumes me. It feels like my head and thoughts don&amp;#39;t stop from the moment I wake up till I fall asleep. I just feel so lost, especially with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much open to any opinions or insight on this, as my family and doctor have struggled with it and is always considered regular anxiety/depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr looking for insight on my depression/anxiety or any other possible mental illnesses, as I have had a hard time with it being diagnosed/discussing with friends or family&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Ok, I realize that this may not be the best place to post this. But I *am* depressed, and I know there are a ton of active users on this sub. So I'm hoping that someone will see this ASAP and lend me a hand.

Here's the deal. I'm an alcoholic. I've been struggling with alcoholism for years (I'm only 19), but this weekend it has become apparent to me that I'm a literal, actual alcoholic. I blacked out last night and woke up in panic, wondering what I had done the night before. Luckily, I didn't do anything that serious (aside from sending a few embarrassing text messages). But even so, I couldn't even make it 3 hours before my shaky hands and panic attacks became too much. I started drinking at 2PM, which is unfortunately commonplace for me at this point.

Anyway, I have work tomorrow. Obviously I can't be drunk during the day, but my withdrawal symptoms are too intense to ignore. So what do I do? On top of that, I'm broke as fuck so I can't even afford to keep buying more booze. I spent $15 on a mickey today, and that's probably the last I can afford for the next week and a half.

So I'm really fucking worried about what I'm gonna do tomorrow. I also have a freelance side project lined up for this week, and that's gonna be just as big of a problem.

The reason I'm drinking so much these days is because I'm trying to cut down on my weed intake. Can you believe that? I replaced one addiction with a different, more serious one. Unbelievable. But anyway, the point is that I don't think I'll be able to make it through the day without getting uncontrollable anxiety due to withdrawal.

I know there are other depressed, alcoholic fucks on this sub, so I'm asking for your help. How am I supposed to survive the day tomorrow? Not only can I not afford it, but I'm just really scared that I'll do something stupid if I don't ""get my fix"". Maybe I'll borrow more money and add onto the 3k+ mountain of debt that I already have. Maybe I'll steal a bottle from the liquor store and get sent to jail. Maybe I'll rob an innocent old lady for 20 bucks just so I can buy some vodka. Fuck.

How am I supposed to do this? I really don't fucking know how I'm gonna survive tomorrow. I don't *think* I'm gonna kill myself, but who knows, maybe the pain will get so bad that I'll have no other option.

Rehab? Maybe. But I can't afford to take that much time off from work. All I have in this world is my apartment and personal space, and I won't be able to maintain those things if I get fired. I'll have to move back in with my parents, and while they're certainly supportive, that is one of the **last** things I want to do right now.

Just- help. If you have any advice to provide, please do. And for the love of God, don't be like my friends and suggest ""just stop drinking"". It's not that fucking simple. So please.

But I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; depressed, and I know there are a ton of active users on this sub. So I&amp;#39;m hoping that someone will see this ASAP and lend me a hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the deal. I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic. I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with alcoholism for years (I&amp;#39;m only 19), but this weekend it has become apparent to me that I&amp;#39;m a literal, actual alcoholic. I blacked out last night and woke up in panic, wondering what I had done the night before. Luckily, I didn&amp;#39;t do anything that serious (aside from sending a few embarrassing text messages). But even so, I couldn&amp;#39;t even make it 3 hours before my shaky hands and panic attacks became too much. I started drinking at 2PM, which is unfortunately commonplace for me at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have work tomorrow. Obviously I can&amp;#39;t be drunk during the day, but my withdrawal symptoms are too intense to ignore. So what do I do? On top of that, I&amp;#39;m broke as fuck so I can&amp;#39;t even afford to keep buying more booze. I spent $15 on a mickey today, and that&amp;#39;s probably the last I can afford for the next week and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD

Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.

Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?

The Full Story (long)

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

The Backstory:

In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to boys on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. 

Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with boys on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. 

When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. 

My Realisation:

In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. 

This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. 

Advice Needed:

This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But I cannot move this, it feels like something that is going to haunt me forever. I want to be better and grow from this - but how can I? It feels like something I shouldn’t be allowed to move on from. 

I’m also going to get help from a therapist of some kind because this has really affected how I view myself and I have been suicidal over this (please don’t be sympathetic - I know the focus should be on my victims). I would appreciate any former catfishers giving me advice on how to discuss this issue with a therapist, as well as how to process this guilt and shame.

Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:

I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. 

To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you.",t2_8yhmtnvn,False,,0,False,I can’t live with my guilt from being a catfish,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k3ody2,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606737837.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Full Story (long)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Backstory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to boys on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with boys on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Realisation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice Needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But I cannot move this, it feels like something that is going to haunt me forever. I want to be better and grow from this - but how can I?

,depression,"To be blunt, I'm a black male. My parents did raise me in the suburbs, but inside the house it was all the good bad and ugly of being in a black household. Black parents do not believe in therapy. The only reason my oldest brother got help was because he was diagnosed with schizoeffective disorder and literally killed a human being.

I used to not be depressed, or at least never admit it, and for good reason; that's like a curse word to black parents. The idea that they work as hard as they do to love and raise us only for us to not be mentally sound is an insult, and depression, suicide, anything mental health related is a taboo (ask your black friends). On top of that, the situation with my big brother was a years-long fiasco and my parents are exhausted from the whole ""crazy children"" ordeal. I'm afraid to be honest with them about how not okay I have been.

2020 has been a hellish year. I've done everything from cry my eyes out to lose control of my temper, attempted suicide a few times, the list goes on. I have great days where I think my depression and anxiety are magically cured, and I have really ugly days where I remember that I actually have no will to live anymore.

I've realized that this isn't healthy, and I need to speak to a professional to unpack myself and get better control of my mental health; but therapists cost money that I can't pay out of pocket, and even if my health insurance could cover it, I can't use it without my parents finding out and making a big deal about it.

I have not been diagnosed with depression, or bipolar disorder, but my doctor has suggested that I get tested to see if I have either one, but my parents are so against it and I feel so hopeless.  Life seems so meaningless and I have a boyfriend and he thinks I'm wonderful and it hurts him when I self harm.  He's been with me for ten months and he has supported me and tried to help me.

,depression,"I'm just sitting here now, crying at 1:30am. I have to get up for college at about 8am, and I can't see myself getting some rest anytime soon.

​

The point is i'm sick of it. im sick of feeling like this. I've genuinely had enough.

A lot of kind people have given me help and advice, however this help has gotten me nowhere, even though I know it helps others to overcome their mental issues. Someone please help me. 

my issues:

\- No motivation. Struggle to even get out of bed in the morning.

\- Plenty of things that I want/need to do but just can't be assed.

\- feeling down for absolutely no reason.

\- Intrusive thoughts 

\- General negativity and pessimism for no real reason. I can't think about ANYTHING in a positive way anymore, I only see negatives.

\- Worrying: I worry about upsetting or burdening people with my issues. I worry that nobody cares. I worry that I'm going to make the people that I care about worry over me. I worry that my mental state isn't getting better; which quite frankly, it isnt.

- decline. I used to talk to myself all the time to help process simple things like how my day went as well as anything negative going on in my life. This doesn't help me deal with it anymore and if anything makes it worse, like many of the other techniques that the people of reddit have suggested. (such as journaling).

​

That's an overall summary. Please feel free to ask me questions or give me advice, absolutely anything is very much appreciated.

It has been a long long day. I just spent 4 hours straight writing my morning down in 8 pages of non fictuitous creativity. (No WAY am I devoting time into homework more than my own pained emotional expression lol.)

,depression,"Let's see... where to begin?

If feel like shit. All day. Every day. There's a part of me that's broken; someplace deep in my brain. The part that makes me move. The part that allows me to focus. The part that's crucial for happiness... yeah... that parts gone.

I'm a shell. A husk. Not even fully human. The light that shines inside the rest of you, mine has faded to dying embers.

You know what it's like, don't you? If your reading this, I'm sure you understand.

You understand the darkness. How its cold embrace is so familiar and inviting... a promise of a warm blanket hidden inside cold lies and empty tomorrows. The grey swollen clouds hang over head always. There is no sun, no joy, no happiness... just the cold dark.

The worst part of it all?

I'm smart.

I'm talking Mensa Candidate smart.

I could have been anything: a surgeon, a pilot, an astronaut, an architect, a lawyer... hell... I could have been president.

But the darkness... My god... its grip is like a vice. It holds so tightly, so completely... it feels like its impossible to break free.

You feel it too, don't you. Like part of you; the part that wants to be free and happy, the part that yearns for joy and life and fulfillment... It's in there... deep inside, locked in a box and trapped in the dark, screaming, yelling, crying to be free... silent in the unending darkness.

I made a plan. 

I sat down and planned it all out...

My life.

Some exercise here, some work there, some time to save and build and focus...

It would take about nine months. It would be hard... but oh so easy. It's just time, after all. Time we all have. Time we all take for granted.

And I would be happy. I would be fit. I would be successful. I would be a new man.

I showed the plan to the darkness and it laughed.

\*""No.""\* it whispered. \*""Stay here. Stay right where you are. Why leave? You know what's at the end of that road. Pain. Disappointment. Heartache. And me. even if you try... even if you take those first steps... I'll be there. I'll always be there. You will never be free of me. I am with you... always.""\*

I cried. Tears of pain, and rage, and hallow wishes.

I prayed. Prayed to a God, any God, not believing in any of them.

I sit here now, slowly killing myself, slowly allowing the darkness to consume me.

\*Do I taste good, fucker?\*

I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of hoping. No more wishes. No more plans.

No more.

Fight your battle, if you must. I'm rooting for you. But my fight is done.

I lost.

I lost hope. I lost the will. I lost myself.

There's only the dark now... and soon... there will be death.

I have failed. My greatest fear has been realized.

I am nothing even though I have everything: A great wife. Good kids. A nine to five. Talent... my god... the talent. I'm handsome. I wont be gracing the cover of any magazines, but women look twice. Family. Friends. They are there too...

 But the darkness turns it into nothing, it makes me focus on whats not, instead of appreciating what is.

What a jest the universe has played; to bare you into a world of light and song and joy and love and potential and possibilities... and then saddles you with this dark passenger; this endless whisper... this eternal torment.

Perhaps I will find peace in the boundless nothing that comes next.

It's quite there, I think. At least I wont hear the screaming of my dying soul anymore.

I am not officially diagnosed with depression, but I'm quite sure I'm depressed. I'm tired of everything. I still try to learn new stuff on my skateboard or guitar but it only makes me feel worse. I give up way too fast and it makes me feel even more worthless.

I really want to talk to someone (my boyfriend knows) but I'm so scared. I need help. I'm too scared to call my GP or open up to my supervisor (he's like a father and I'm welcome to talk to him). I also want to tell my parents but I'm so scared. 

My feelings are only getting worse and I'm constantly thinking about what stuff I'm going to leave behind for my loved ones. I want to make a box for every person in my life with stuff that I want them to have so they can look at it when they miss me.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year me and my SO of 8 years split up. We have 3 kids together. I stayed in the house we were living in (and she was helping me) until the beginning of this month. Fucking weird but I had to move back in with my parents. I haven't really seen them much in the past 8 years because of some crazy shit that went down when I was younger. Long story short, me and a woman back then had a kid, shit in my life hit the fan and I lost custody of him because I couldn't even afford to hardly take care of myself. Then my mom swooped in and just completely through me under the bus and took custody of him. Things were ok at first but we would get into heated arguments on ""who was the REAL father"". So over these past 8 years I haven't seen him much because my parents are just complete shit. But yet, here I am...after simply asking if I could stay here over the course of a couple months.   
Well now I don't get to see my daughters a whole lot either. I work 6 days a week ( because finding employment in my current situation is complete and utter garbage. ) so when I get to the house today I ask my mom if I couldn't go and pick up my girls tonight. (FYI my mom is the picture perfect fucking  narcissist ) She begins to spout out how ""school starts tomorrow again and this and that"". Basically her way of saying no. Just to build some context I was visiting my girls a couple nights ago and when I was about to leave they were crying and everything so I was like ok ok I will take you guys with me. Well when I get back to my parents house and go to say hello my mom gave me the fucking stink eye and starting going off about how she was sick and shit. So I ended up just getting me and my girls a hotel room so I could see them that night.

  
Idk...but this is all becoming too fucking much. Me being there for my girls means absolutely everything to me....but I have no way to see them...like...WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO?!? I mean these people are so fucking petty that you can TASTE the fucking jealousy because my son (who has been with them these past 8 years) is so connected to me ( even though he doesn't know who the fuck I am ). I mean I am really at a breaking point here, it's either live here or live out of my fucking car. Since me bringing my girls over here ( for just ONE fucking night a week!! ) is too god damn much I am thinking about just living out of my dam car. Or just calling it fucking quits.

,depression,"This is a long post. Very long. I just needed to vent about everthring....

As the title suggest...I really don't know. I don't know if I can continue with what I feel is a hollow existence of mine.

These past couple of years have been horrible but like many of you might agree 2020 is hell. I started my year off on a sad foot because I stepped up to the plate to care for my terminal grandmother. She had 9 kids but none of them put their lives on hold for her. I did. I was already feeling like a failure because school didn't work out because my mother didn't file in time for my FASFA and it got so expensive I had to drop out my first semester. I was devastated. Now I owe the school over 5k and I can't to back to school until then.

Anyways, I came back to my hometown and carried for my grandmother because I love(d) her with all my being. I stayed those long, painful nights by her side. I was losing my mind watching my grandmother waste away. Meanwhile, I had not a cent to my name unless it was the little 100 dollars my mom sent twice a month. I was broke, didn't have a car, and was 24/7 caretaking. 

However, I didn't blame my grandmother but I started feeling guilty because I would want her pain to stop. I wanted her to go home and be at peace. I felt evil wishing her what she wanted,  death.

Then, when her kids finally came around she took her last breath. I was there. Like I promised her. I cleaned her up and got her ready for the hospices nurses to pronounce her time of death. 

I must admit there were days I would look at her kitchen knives, imaging that familiar sting and bite of a knife. This time though I didn't want to just feel the cuts. I wanted to feel Death wrap me in her sweet embrace. Then I would snap out of it and remember I was all my grandmother had in the end. She begged me not to ever leave her and I didn't. 

Since she has passed I know live with my mother...again. I love my mother but I don't really like her. 

When I first cut myself I had to be either 13 or 14. I was able to pull it off and lied and said the dog was scratching me. She believed me...until the cuts became more like carvings. 

My mother had a large wooden paddle she used on me and my brother. She beat me because I cut myself. My butt was swollen for days.  Funny thing is...my mother was a fucking psychology major who wanted to help adolescents. I always find that rich and ironic. 

There are plenty of things I resent her for and those are one. Anyways, I live with her and her long time partner. I hate it. I feel like a failure. I don't have a car, no license, nothing to show any success. 

Now I'm spending the holidays with my boyfriend and it's been the Hoildays of Hell. He hated the Thanksgiving meal I eagerly made him. Two days of laboring for him to say the only thing that was okay was the turkey. We've argued almost everyday since I've been here. He's rarely here, first it was him taking finals (I understood) now he's pulling as many shifts at work he possibly can. So, I'm alone at the house with no human interaction. I have no friends. I sit here and reflect on how I have failed and accomplish nothing. 

I quit my call Center job I had because the people were abusive, it was sickening. I got a job a really wanted but their training schedule is legit once a day every couple of days. The first check I got from them was 33 dollars. They only pay 10 dollars and hr. So, I'm crazy broke,  I have a weekly bill that I can no longer afford, and this is the first Chirstmas I won't be able to buy anyone anything. To top it all off Amazon overdrawed my account by almost 90 dollars for something I still haven't recived.

I try to count my blessings but each day they become lesser and lesser. I find myself in bed until the day is almost over. Not doing anything. It takes so much energy just to feed myself.....I just don't know anymore.

&lt;p&gt;Since she has passed I know live with my mother...again. I love my mother but I don&amp;#39;t really like her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first cut myself I had to be either 13 or 14. I was able to pull it off and lied and said the dog was scratching me. She believed me...until the cuts became more like carvings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother had a large wooden paddle she used on me and my brother. She beat me because I cut myself. My butt was swollen for days.  Funny thing is...my mother was a fucking psychology major who wanted to help adolescents. I always find that rich and ironic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of things I resent her for and those are one. Anyways, I live with her and her long time partner. I hate it. I feel like a failure. I don&amp;#39;t have a car, no license, nothing to show any success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m spending the holidays with my boyfriend and it&amp;#39;s been the Hoildays of Hell. He hated the Thanksgiving meal I eagerly made him. Two days of laboring for him to say the only thing that was okay was the turkey. We&amp;#39;ve argued almost everyday since I&amp;#39;ve been here. He&amp;#39;s rarely here, first it was him taking finals (I understood) now he&amp;#39;s pulling as many shifts at work he possibly can. So, I&amp;#39;m alone at the house with no human interaction. I have no friends. I sit here and reflect on how I have failed and accomplish nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit my call Center job I had because the people were abusive, it was sickening. I got a job a really wanted but their training schedule is legit once a day every couple of days. The first check I got from them was 33 dollars. They only pay 10 dollars and hr. So, I&amp;#39;m crazy broke,  I have a weekly bill that I can no longer afford, and this is the first Chirstmas I won&amp;#39;t be able to buy anyone anything. To top it all off Amazon overdrawed my account by almost 90 dollars for something I still haven&amp;#39;t recived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to count my blessings but each day they become lesser and lesser. I find myself in bed until the day is almost over. Not doing anything. It takes so much energy just to feed myself.....I just don&amp;#39;t know anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the novella....there&amp;#39;s so much more I wanted to type 😊...&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Okay, this is probably going to be a long post/rant, but I need to write it for the sake of my sanity because this has caused me to spiral into a new level of depression and anxiety.

The last 2 years have been rough for me and my family (wife and 2 kids under 10). I left grad school 2 years ago while completing my PhD (which is now finally ready to submit this coming week so I can officially be done with it). We moved from the Northeast back down to the Southeastern US to live with my mother. We did this for several reasons, primarily because of financial limitations. During that timeframe, my wife began to notice some of my mom’s habits that were concerning (my wife is a mental health counselor). For the most part, I didn’t interpret them as quite so serious because they were mostly things like putting stuff away in weird places and losing everyday items (sometimes for days or even weeks at a time; things like keys and cell phone). We all lose shit from time to time and/or misplace things, so I just chalked most of it up to general absent-mindedness that comes with age for all of us. 

But shit really started to hit the fan about 6 months ago, and snowballed on us in the last 2 weeks. Since we had lived with my mom, she’s been convinced that people have been stealing things from her house. Her accusations were, at first, primarily levied against a couple of cousins and an aunt and uncle of mine, a couple of people in the neighborhood known to have stolen things in the past, and a shady woman that had lived with my mom for a short period before we moved in. It was impossible to prove any of these people had really stolen anything, so we just sort of listened to mom and tried to alleviate her concerns by telling her we would be mindful not to let anyone she suspected have access to the house. I even installed some security cameras and flood lights to go with a new backyard fence (I didn’t install the fence). A little security surely couldn’t hurt. 

Another part of the reason that we couldn’t prove any of the aforementioned people had stolen anything, was because most of the items mom claimed were constantly being stolen were things like batteries, light bulbs, laundry detergent, and other every-day use items. And to be clear, there were at least 2 valuable things that had gone missing but both of those items appear to have gone missing when the shady woman was living there (and we are convinced this woman stole at least those 2 things because others who also knew her have noted that she’s a thief). But the majority of the alleged items going missing, were not exactly the sort of thing one takes to a pawn shop for cash.

Fast forward to January 2020. Between being unemployed for several months, plus teaching online via Zoom once the Fall 2020 semester started, in addition to the pandemic/lockdown, I was home every single day. I know for a fact that there was no one coming into the house and stealing shit. But about 6 months ago, mom began to behave more erratically. In addition to the items being “stolen,” she was now also convinced that things were being broken on purpose, and that people where she works were conspiring against her to get her fired. She had cut off contact with several of her friends as well as some family members because she was convinced that they were part of it, and then she began to lash out at me, accusing me of being part of this all in some way. We had a big fight, which really only resulted in me being more confused, but I still (for the most part) believed her. After all, where she worked has a track record for forcing people into early retirement or get fired, and maybe some shit had been stolen since we had lived there because I certainly couldn’t prove otherwise. 

Then, about 2 weeks ago came the final straw that broke the camel’s back. Again, she blows up at me and my wife. She can’t list anything that’s been stolen since January when I’ve been home every day, but she’s still convinced stuff is being stolen and that we’re either allowing it to happen or actively helping in some way. She’s convinced that “they” are breaking things to fuck with her and make her feel insane, and in addition she accuses us of breaking things that are costing her massive amounts of money (never mind that the things that have broken since we’ve been there have been largely replaced by us and definitely haven’t come at her expense: like the oven/stovetop and garbage disposal). Now she’s directly of accusing us of working with a group of people to steal/break things to drive her insane. She even accuses us of either deleting videos from the cameras I installed or letting these co-conspirators have access to the cameras to delete the videos. That’s the only way she can justify the paucity of evidence from the cameras. She accuses us of working with people we don’t talk to, don’t know, have never met, or haven’t seen in decades. In her mind, her sister and brother-in-law (my aunt and uncle I mentioned previously) are working with people in the HR department plus supervisors where she works, plus the wife of an ex-husband, plus the people in the neighborhood she’s accused previously. None of it makes any sense to my wife or I, not even if we try and bend the rules of logic to try and understand the conspiracy she’s presented us with. We tell her that, based on her telling us that she’s talked with some of these people and they’ve all but confirmed we’re in on this conspiracy, she needs to give us contact info for these people because if they are using our names then we need to have a word with them. She refuses, blows up at us one last time, tells we need to move out, and walks away. 

So, I do the only thing I know to do at that moment, I drive to my aunt and uncle’s house (the aunt and uncle she believes are the brain-trust behind this whole thing). Now, I haven’t talked to my uncle since at least 2010 at the funeral of another uncle of mine, and I haven’t spoken to my aunt since before the pandemic when she sent me a text (not to mention I’d only spoken to her in person once and exchanged maybe 2-3 texts since we had moved into mom’s house). We’ve also specifically avoided this particular aunt and uncle while we lived with mom because of the tension she said existed between them, we didn’t want mom to think we were siding with anyone against her because we genuinely fucking weren’t. 

If they were conspiring with anyone to do anything to mom, I was going to find out (my wife also ended up driving out separately and showed up while we were there). One thing I knew for sure after talking with them, is that they were definitely not part of any conspiracy to steal mom’s shit nor drive her insane. They were blindsided by most of the accusations, but were even more shocked to find that mom had said such hateful things about them to us because she believed that they hated her and were jealous of her. 

I’m still completely floored by all of this, but that day I cried more than I had since my aforementioned uncle passed. My wife and I knew something was definitely wrong with mom, whether it was a highly unlikely conspiracy that made no logical or rational sense and had no evidence to substantiate it, or that something was mentally wrong, it didn’t really matter. We found a place the next day and moved our shit the day after that. We knew it would be a bad idea to stay there any longer with our kids. We have essentially no money and had to borrow enough from my wife’s sister to cover the deposit to move into our new place. We were on a shoestring budget before but now we’re really stretched thin.

We also tried to do as much of the packing and moving as we could without telling mom, but found that to be futile because it was clear (based on text messages she sent us) that she was using the cameras I had installed to watch us. The day after we moved out, she changed the wifi password and had a home security system installed. She has since continued to text either me, my wife, or both of us long rants about her conspiracy. Most of it seems to at least hint that she is not actively accusing us right now of anything, but the shit still doesn’t make any sense and the conspiracy has now grown to include my dad (who doesn’t really have anything to do with my mom any longer), my half-brother (who probably hasn’t spoken to my mom is 30 years), his wife (I’m not even sure if they’ve ever met or spoken to one another), and even the cops because they responded to her home security system going off (probably set off from inside by the dogs) and didn’t catch anyone doing anything. She’s said that she’s found pennies and random bits of wire under some of her windows and that this is apparently an old trick the cops do for…some fucking reason that’s nefarious. 

I don’t know what to believe with respect to my mom any longer. We are now seriously concerned that we’re seeing signs of early onset dementia or a stroke. Concerns that are serious enough that a different aunt of mine (who is a former nurse who’s late husband suffered from Alzheimer’s) has been trying to get mom to talk to her and to at least consider seeing a doctor. But thus far, nothing seems to be working and she just keeps going further down the rabbit hole. You can’t help someone who is convinced they don’t need it.

I’m not even mad anymore, I’m terrified. I’m scared for her. I’m concerned that her illogical and irrational beliefs will turn into illogical and irrational actions. I don’t want to talk to her, not only for my own mental health but because thus far nothing I’ve said to her has done anything but make things worse and send her further into these paranoid delusions. 

I don’t know if my mom is “insane,” but I do know she believes highly illogical and irrational things that have led her to accusing her son and daughter-in-law of trying to actively harm her mentally and financially, in addition to kicking us out along with her own grandchildren during the middle of a pandemic and the fucking holiday season.

I had never experienced anxiety/depression and panic attacks until that year that everything happened but now that I have and gotten to a point where I can tell you I barely feel anxious or depressed because I refuse to feel that way again. I write this message not at a time where my life is going well. My life is actually all over the place at the moment to be honest. But I am still confident that depression and anxiety is something you may overcome and become strong enough to defeat it to the point it barely impacts you. You can do it. I promise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish someone could have told me this years ago so I hope this message reaches someone in that same position and they can skip a few hard steps I had to go through. Much love.&lt;/p&gt;

Hes really wonderful and ive spent every day for a year taking care of him after I got him, we aren't sure how old he is but we think he's at least 3.

Im not sure what I'll do if I lose him. I have family and friends, and I know they love me, but the question is, are they worth living for?

I know people say that they're worth living for but for some reason the only thing I can think of when I think of living is Bandit, I take care of him and he listens to me (even though he can't hear) but we work on a mutual trust based relationship. I dont disrespect him and his space and in turn he comes to me willingly which is a hard feat for chameleons. 

Its honestly sad that I can't imagine living in a world without a lizard because I know, its just a lizard, but I built a bond with him that I dont have with anyone or anything else. He treats me with the respect that I give him. I dont know what else I can live for if he leaves me

,depression,"I'm a college student and I live alone in an apartment that belongs to my family. I've always struggled with keeping it clean and I guess that very common, but this year it really feels different. Before, I used to clean up at least every 2 weeks, but now I just haven't. I posted this here because I think it has to do with the way I've been feeling, some days I can barely drag myself out of bed. There's also some past trauma that I've been trying to move on from.

I wonder if anyone here has any tips on how to clean my apartment. I just feel like all of this clutter is keeping me in a funky headspace, but at the same time my headspace prevents me from cleaning up the clutter. I've tried starting small, and doing one thing each day, but eventually it all starts feeling so pointless and I go back to where I was before. I've tried making a daily schedule where I plan all the things I want to do, but I end up feeling more and more tired thinking of all the things I wrote and all the times I haven't kept up with said schedule.

I feel like if I just cleaned up I could think more clearly and maybe invite people over, stop being by myself all the time. I also think I would stop feeling so ashamed of myself. But all of this negative thoughts just overwhelm me and stop me from cleaning. 

I also feel the need to clarify that this is a real mess, like theres a gigant mountain of dishes and I don't have a dishwasher so I'd have to wash them by hand. There's also lots of clothes that need to be washed and folded, but I don't have a machine for drying clothes, so they need to be air dried. I also need to clean up the fridge and the stove from head to toe, etc.  What I'm trying to say is that theres no way I could just finish it all in one suddent burst of inspiration.

,depression,"Hi,

Does anyone else feel semi-functional whilst at work, but then absolutely collapse in the evenings/on weekends?

I feel like I put on a front at work, and that I either kind of have begun to believe it, or that I am just too stressed/numb to feel the depression in the working-day. Sometimes it’s there as negative thoughts, tiredness, depersonalisation etc, but it’s not nearly as bad as it normally is.

But then, the second I get home and unpack or whatever, I just collapse. I can’t think straight. The depression kicks right back in. It’s there before work too, in the mornings. 

Is this normal? It’s exhausting. I don’t enjoy my work, and I now can’t enjoy my ‘free time’ either. But because I feel functional at work, I feel like I’m faking my ‘part-time’ depression.

,depression,"Keeping people at arm’s length, rather than letting them in to see everything that I am, is a way smarter approach for me now, it seems. 

In other words, keeping things more casual with people and not expecting anything from anybody makes me feel hollow inside, but at least I won’t get hurt as deeply if they decide to dip out of my life. 

Like, recently I noticed that I don’t have anyone close enough to me in my life that I’d consider a “best friend”, or someone that I trust enough to give my whole heart to. I can only tell around to people that “I’m here to make friends if you want” so many times before I just sound desperate. I *want* someone to *want* my company as a part of their life on the regular so that I feel like maybe I have some sort of purpose. I know now that anyone I care deeply about likely doesn’t care about me in that way. I’ve grown to accept it, as much as it hurts. (I say “grown” like I’m some aged scholar; I’m young; I’m in college).

But when you’re so run down by being by yourself and going through the daily motions of life, you start to feel dull and numbed to everything. People need other people to survive and thrive; as much as I get anxious about socializing with people, it’s better to have someone in my life that I can trust won’t leave me than to have it engrained in my psyche that everyone is purely temporary and that I’m completely forgettable. 

Every friendship I’ve ever been a part of has fizzled out in less than a few years-time. It’s the little things I’m more aware of: hearing from other people less, being left on “read” all the time, less enthusiasm about the prospects of hanging out, keeping conversations short...overthinking at its best. Too often the ball is in their court and it just sits there. I know I shouldn’t expect anything or feel obligated to be responded to, but when it’s almost a pattern, it starts to sting more and more.

Pets are pretty cool though. I’ve had pets my whole life. Maybe I’ll just stick to having cats rather than trying to take opportunities with people like darts and throw them at the wall until something sticks.

Its been 2,5 years of suffering, soon 3, and im tired of getting high on meds to the point of barely being able to walk, only to sleep, then look like a druggie the whole day from being sedated. I hate my symptoms, cant even talk about it

But.. only with one person, who already has a boyfriend, so she is my best friend. I tell her how i love her everytime im stoned at 3am...

I cant believe i cant find anyone like that, if she didnt have a boyfriend i would just try and you know.. i told her that its only self control, and how i feel, she understands and said she wouldnt be mad even if i lost control over my emotions

I dont want them to break up, i really dont, i have dirty thoughts but i never try to push them apart, i encourage her to stay with him at her bad times.

But then who will be here with me? I would need physical contact, not sexual, only cuddling and stuff that i never could experience in my life.

It's a numbness and sometimes I think it's worse than the days I can't get out of bed. my life demands so much of me since I'm in school and edtraceucciulars so I have no choice but to go out in the world and pretend. except it's not even pretending at this point, because people notice. I go about my day, doing what's needed of me to the best of my ability. I make the grades, I get the positions, and I'm considered ""successful"". Except I'm doing all of this with a feeling of extreme numbness. These things dont bring me joy, and not doing them doesn't bring me sadness.

,depression,"The fact I am lonley and depressed causes me to get attached or become needy real easy. I would not call someone a friend who doesn't doesn't care to reach out to me or talk to me to ask me if I am okay, can we hang out or anything so what is even the point.  I do not have nobody because I am hating Georgia so bad but The fact I am lonely on my birthday just because me or my mom is the only ones who will be there but I ain't got no friends makes me feel lonely. I have showed up for people lots of times but nobody wants to show up for me anymore messes with my feelings which causes me to feel like I do. Whether I be nice or being the depressed person ever but mostly when I am happy still people is going to leave but which makes me not want to do anything which is why I hardly ever leave the house. People is going to keep leaving or either unfriending me or blocking when I did nothing wrong or to deserve it will get me to a point I do have a backup messenger account I will end up going off on people who done that to me and say to them so you do not care about me unlike other people you talk to because nobody stays in my life. I feel like I am on a urge of a breakdown  because of doing to things like this happening and if people don't care then I don't care about myself or feel like wanting to do anything is why I sleep all day but just never find the motivation to do anything! I am tired of people playing games with me and if your not going to not talk to me on Facebook but in public please stop because i ain't got time for these twisted mind games! People doesn't know what I go through so I hide what I go through and be happy to see if people will talk to me but still people leave so I am over it! 

Just know I will never get over a person because when I meet new people they are just like them because everyone is the same because everyone leaves because I can't name a person who never will because people add me to block me or ignore the next day when all I ever do is being nice. I know what I got to do let me anger out, punch something or myself because I can't be something that people wants me to be because me being depressed people doesn't want to talk to me so I tried being happy but still nobody does talk to me. I am disabled and I struggle making friends or even opening up to people like in public because I don't speak first because it's too hard to explain like having social anxiety! I do not know if I can have social anxiety if I ain't diagnosed with something because I am too shy to talk to people first or message because I have no idea what to say or get to know people like I want which I was in special ed in school makes me be afraid because I fear of being bullied because I am a quiet person. 
I get left on read when I speak my mind or say anything and nobody gets back to me over years and 2 years now but I won't go chasing nobody even though I get attached easy and become needy because want real friends including people in my life that can be like a sister to me, close friend or brother I can talk to about anything even if it is music but who will never leave or stop talking to me through my darkest times. 
My birthday is Saturday December 5th.

I am going to be lonely especially them are the same friends who left me when I moved away and because I get treated wrong when i moved away from them and Georgia because it seemed they never wanted to talk to me anymore but decided to talk to me when I was in another state talking about they might as well not be my friend unless I came back, starting calling me and my mom names and talking crap about me because my mom had no way to get me so if I go back to the abuse that is why because nobody and like them who I want to come around won't come back around so I am done because I know he won't leave me like everyone else will do and nobody else I can stay with who will help me because I will struggle alone and I can't get a job because they will cut my check because that is what my mom said they will do if I work because I am disabled. So I got nobody else but him and she doesn't care if I go back to him and when I ask her anything she is like she can't help it so I will not bother talking to her about anything if I am such a burden or a terrible person or a waste of space because he is the only way I can move out of state. It will take all i got living on my own because when I pay phone and buy groceries I am broke so i don't make enough living on my own! I lost my friends and I lost everything so he is my only choice as it seems! Nobody understands mental illness and I shut myself out because nobody gets it because the fact I move away I won't be called mean things my stepdad saids about me or get accused of things that is not true about me when I know who I am and the things he saids I do I don't do.

I'm a that friendly nerd that every school has, I have finally some friends, but... not everything is ok
My problems with mental health started when my grandpa died, or earlier. I have really toxic parents, even though they love me, they just don't realize they hurt me. They critisize my weight, my style, my fucking everything.
I was bullied in middle school, I was a strange, but I smart kid.
Although I'm in better school now, my relationship with parents got better, but my mental health is getting worse. Every small fucking thing annoys me, I hate the way I look, talk, I think I'm dumb and I don't know anything. But I have no motivation.
I fucking lost myself. Idk who I am, what I love, what I feel. I can't go to a phycologist as in my parents won't allow my, plus it's really expensive for a 16 years old girl...

&lt;p&gt;Edited: Wowww, I didn&amp;#39;t expect these much support, I really appreciate that&amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Quarantine has been really getting to my head recently. All the joy in my life has been completely sucked away. I was in my last year of middle school and was about to graduate. We were going to go to Washington D.C. for a field trip, which I had been looking forward to my entire middle school career.

I was going to have to say goodbye to everyone. My friends, my teachers who I had gotten so attached to after 3 years. It was going to be sad, but I was ready to move on and excited for the future. Little did I know I was about to get into the worst year of my life.

Once quarantine happened, my friends and I were all excited. We thought virtual school would be fun and it would only be for a month. But that month passed. And another. And another. Graduation was virtual and afterwards my friends sent me a bunch of half hearted goodbye messages.

I’ve been stuck inside for the past 8 months now and by life feels completely meaningless. I feel like my life is actively being taken from me. All these memories and good times I was supposed to have have been taken away and I’m worried I’ll have tons of regrets about the things I didn’t get to experience when I’m older.

I’m stuck in the same loop everyday. I go to school on the computer and then spend the rest of my day on my phone. I feel like a complete failure and I’m reminded everyday when I look at myself in the mirror.

I’m in high school now and I don’t know anybody. We don’t really get a chance to talk to each other because the teachers always telling us to shut up. I have no one to talk to and I try reaching out to my friends but they’re too busy with THEIR school to reach out. 

Whenever we do talk, things are really forced and things don’t flow as naturally as they used to. I feel like I almost don’t know them anymore.

 My parents asked me yesterday if I was feeling okay. They’ve been really stressed out with financial troubles because my dads company is going through hard times. I don’t want to worry then anymore so I just fake a smile and say that I’m doing great while I try not to let the sadness overtake me.

Anyway, that’s just how I’ve been feeling recently. I know posting this on Reddit is a weird thing to do but I just need to get all this out of my system. Hopefully this situation we’re all in is over soon so I can move on with my life.

And actually going to school was a nightmare!

Even walking incorrectly was a worry. It even transfered over to college. In more recent years I started heavily questioning my own life. ""I'm too afraid of doing something wrong to get a job"" or ""why would anyone watch my videos, there are so many creators better than me"". I would always compare myself to others, and I heavily debated taking my own life for being a useless slob. I even wrote a will. One night, I couldn't take it anymore, and I texted my best friend and asked if he was open to talk the next day. I had never told anyone these things before so this was a big step for me. We've been best friends since kindergarten. We've got more memories than either of us can count. I went to his college campus, and told him the huge history of what made me depressed and why school was so terrible. To his credit, he was a very good listener. He even shared some of his school dilemmas. Apparently, he was bullied/disliked for being my friend. Everyone but him would be invited to events for the basketball team. The fact that he continued being my friend regardless of these things made me cry on the inside. It showed me that people can put on very convincing faces. I finally got to the part of wanting to kill myself. After my story was over, he started talking to me about whether I was saved or not. Now, I'm in a Christian family, and we both attended a private school. I've heard these things hundreds of times. I've become numb to it all. This didn't upset me or anything, since I knew he was just trying to help, but then he made a suggestion.
 ""Did you tell your parents?"" 
Now, I know my parents. I also know exactly how they would react if I told them that I was depressed or had constant anxiety. Without going into details, it would NOT help the problem. Telling my parents might even make it worse, depending. So I responded ""no"" to my friend. I know normally, telling your parents would probably be a good thing, but not in my case. I was more confident in my own abilities to get better without my parents getting in on it. After this, we went our separate ways. It actually helped to share my problem with him, i was surprised. A week later I went to visit him again. This time it didn't have anything to do with my mental state, I just wanted to hang out. Once it was almost time to head out, he asked me about how I was doing. I responded by telling him about how talking really helped. Then he asked it again.
""Did you tell your parents?""
I answered the same say i did the week before. ""It wouldn't help, i know how they'll react""
He wasn't having it. He suggested again that I tell them.
I said no.
He said it again.
I said no.
This happened several times, each time getting more intense than the last. He finally pulled his phone out and threatened to call my mom. I tried convincing him that it will only make things worse, but he wasn't having it. I was half tempted to grab the phone out of his hand and delete the contact info. But I knew he could just get it back if I did. 
He hit the ""Call"" button. When my mom answered, he didn't actually tell her anything, but he basically told her that I have a big problem to talk to her about. I told my mom that I'd call her later on my own phone and hung up. The last thing I told my friend was that he made a big mistake, and to not be surprised to not hear from me for a while. I managed to squirm out of having to tell my parents about it, but the next few weeks were miserable. I was so afraid of them figuring it out, and they were getting close, but they never did. Fast forward to present day(two months later), and I have gotten out of my depression and anxiety mindset. I basically forced it out of myself, if that makes sense. I made a consistent diet, started exercising, judging myself less, and comparing myself to others far less. I'm not 100%, but I feel better than I ever have. My mindset was: ""If I don't have the problem, then my parents won't ever figure it out."" But now I have a new problem. What do I do about my friend? On the one hand, he shouldn't have tried to force a solution to MY problem. But on the other hand, he sort of indirectly helped by attempting to tell my parents. I don't want to never see him again or something. But at the same time, what if he's not convinced and tries to tell them AGAIN, but directly this time. I'm conflicted and I welcome any ideas/advice. I don't know how to confront my best friend again.

I was more confident in my own abilities to get better without my parents getting in on it. After this, we went our separate ways. It actually helped to share my problem with him, i was surprised. A week later I went to visit him again. This time it didn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with my mental state, I just wanted to hang out. Once it was almost time to head out, he asked me about how I was doing. I responded by telling him about how talking really helped. Then he asked it again.
&amp;quot;Did you tell your parents?&amp;quot;
I answered the same say i did the week before. &amp;quot;It wouldn&amp;#39;t help, i know how they&amp;#39;ll react&amp;quot;
He wasn&amp;#39;t having it. He suggested again that I tell them.
I said no.
He said it again.
I said no.
This happened several times, each time getting more intense than the last. He finally pulled his phone out and threatened to call my mom. I tried convincing him that it will only make things worse, but he wasn&amp;#39;t having it. I was half tempted to grab the phone out of his hand and delete the contact info. But I knew he could just get it back if I did. 
He hit the &amp;quot;Call&amp;quot; button. When my mom answered, he didn&amp;#39;t actually tell her anything, but he basically told her that I have a big problem to talk to her about. I told my mom that I&amp;#39;d call her later on my own phone and hung up. The last thing I told my friend was that he made a big mistake, and to not be surprised to not hear from me for a while. I managed to squirm out of having to tell my parents about it, but the next few weeks were miserable. I was so afraid of them figuring it out, and they were getting close, but they never did. Fast forward to present day(two months later), and I have gotten out of my depression and anxiety mindset. I basically forced it out of myself, if that makes sense. I made a consistent diet, started exercising, judging myself less, and comparing myself to others far less. I&amp;#39;m not 100%, but I feel better than I ever have. My mindset was: &amp;quot;If I don&amp;#39;t have the problem, then my parents won&amp;#39;t ever figure it out.&amp;quot; But now I have a new problem. What do I do about my friend? On the one hand, he shouldn&amp;#39;t have tried to force a solution to MY problem. But on the other hand, he sort of indirectly helped by attempting to tell my parents. I don&amp;#39;t want to never see him again or something. But at the same time, what if he&amp;#39;s not convinced and tries to tell them AGAIN, but directly this time. I&amp;#39;m conflicted and I welcome any ideas/advice. I don&amp;#39;t know how to confront my best friend again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post, but I simply don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"For some reason, I care about some things and don't care for other things. What I mean is what I value has completely changed.

Sometimes, I keep thinking about my appearance and whether I get along with others.

But I don't care for my future. I don't care about school or college.

I feel that maybe the reason why I care about my appearance and my social skills is because all I care about is being accepted and cared for. I want people to like me. I want people to be affectionate with me and tell me I mean something when I can't help feeling worthless.

I don't know why. It's like I have given up on my future. I can't really think about what the future will be like. I can't really envision my future. I don't care for goals such as getting good grades in school and getting into a good college. I just don't care. I would be fine ending my life before having to deal with greater responsibilities, but it's really difficult to succeed with that. But I know at the same time, as a high schooler, I should make sure I can achieve those (doing properly in school/college), so I can be financially independent and be able to support myself.

But I don't know why goals like that are not connected to my self-esteem but more on purpose. I don't know how to get myself to care. You could say that discipline is only important, but I need to make sure I have a good perspective. We all do certain things because it means something to us, but the thing is I don't care if I do bad in school.

You could say I'm blaming depression. Um, I wasn't like this in the past. I worked hard in school. That was 7 months ago. I was the type of person who would get As. Now, I'm putting minimal effort. I'm just wondering how can I change my mindset. I'm sorry, I know I come across as shallow and attention-seeking and someone who does not care for long-term goals.

By appearance, I mean I'm trying to eat healthy and exercise. By social skills, I want to read more to become interesting. This is ideal tho. Everything's been on and off. It's hard dealing with classes while also dealing with after-school things (taekwondo, tutoring class). Like one week, I try hard on things like being healthy and reading. The next week, I rush on work. I'm not good at managing my time.

I understand discipline is important, but I would like to know if there's a way I can change my mindset. You can definitely call me out in the comments for how I'm being wrong.

I know it's not as bad as others, but I would appreciate advice.

**The reason why I find it hard for me is I was already a procrastinator in the past when I was not depressed.** When I was not depressed, I would use my time after-school reading webtoons honestly, and only at like 9-11 pm, I actually started doing work. But I worked hard. Now, I think things are harder. I'm not using my time on hobbies though. I mainly doing nothing all day - hearing music and overthinking things. I try to get work done, but I feel really down (not neutral) that it's hard to pay attention to work. I feel I need to always keep my headphones on to keep my mood elevated, but I end up paying attention to the music too much. Some days, I cry a lot and I think it gets hard to go back to doing work because I feel really tired. I also have headaches pretty much all the time, and pain medication does not help.

You see, I was the kid who worked hard in school, but I was very lonely. I worked hard because I had a plan, and I had hope that maybe I can be successful in the future. Then, it hit me that I had trouble improving on my SAT and in junior year, I was trying harder than the previous years, and I wasn't seeing the results I wanted. I wasn't doing bad, but I was feeling resentful. It also hit me that maybe my social skills will never get better. So, I should stop thinking that I can postpone things and just focus on studies. I don't have leadership skills or public speaking skills, so I found it hard to get leadership positions in extracurriculars. I also had the realization that I'm below average, so I care more about my appearance. I always felt insecure about it, and I felt I always gave people bad first impressions. I really want to get along with people, and I feel maybe lookism had something to do with why I was having trouble.

I feel that with me in the past, because I had goals, I could do the work because I would feel good that I'd be doing well in school and if I told myself that I would do bad if I don't work on this now, I would work hard because I wouldn't want that to happen. It was like maybe a carrot-stick system. The thing is I cared and I had a plan set out for my future.

&lt;p&gt;Then, when I started working, that&amp;#39;s where it all crashed. Haven&amp;#39;t been able to hold a job more than a year and I&amp;#39;m jobless. I&amp;#39;m planning to give tuition cause I can work at my own leisure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is something wrong with me? Why can&amp;#39;t I work 8 to 5?&lt;/p&gt;

i can't bitch about it to her because from her perspective, it's her fault, and that will only make her more upset.

i can't bitch about it to anyone else because they don't get it either. all i can do is bury my feelings and hope my subconscious will process them into something less unbearable.

,depression,"Hi. There is more than 2 years now since I’ve lost my self esteem, I am not confident anymore, I don’t think about myself as being a beautiful woman anymore and I have the feeling that every other woman is more beautiful than I am.

The context: I am crazy in love with my actual bf and everything started the first time we met. At that time, he used to fuck a lot of girls and he was obsessed about his ex who left him and still in love with her. For 1 and half years, he was having sex with me and other 4 girls (he told me- I was so stupid back then thinking that I have to appreciate his honesty and He will be mine if I accept that.

,depression,So my gf sent me an image of like a bracelet that's for couples and we're meeting up tomorrow but I'm in a very bad place right now as in I don't want to see tomorrow. So her sending that really just like hurt or something I'm somewhat expressing how I'm feeling(massively underpaying my desire to die). I'm feeling like hell because my mum had a call complaining about how her bf is upset about how she has to take care of 2 homes and work so shes unable to clean his house. For context I'm a 17M in 6th form (basically high-school) and my mum has basically moved with her bf who I'veet like 5 times and wants me to move in but obviously I don't want to so she cleans both houses and works. So I'm thinking this is her trying to guilt me into moving in with him and her. I like neither of them. Uhhh I'm losing my self here (sorry I'm kinda drunk). I'm quite obviously mentally fucked up and mainly alone besides the lies I tell. So I'm not really looking for advice or anything just ranting but advice is welcome. After she left I messaged her that I'd move in with them. And then I began to cry for the first time in years yay.

,depression,"Humans are vermin.

Humans are vermin, they are too shallow to love.

Humans are vermin and anything you can do to earn their love is disgusting.

I hope you kept the limbs you cut off to make friends.

I hope the stench of your own rotting flesh keeps you up at night.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope something happens in the future to make your friends regret making you cut yourself into pieces for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans are too shallow for love.

No human (a) can love another human (b) unless (b) violently disfigures themselves and limits their own potential in order to fit what (a) wants.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have anyone who loves you, know that you are (b) and you are an incomplete person.

&amp;#x200B;

I, the unloved, am the only complete one.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I refuse to sacrifice my dignity for you vermin.

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to feel like garbage because you want me to be like you.

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to stop thinking just because you can't handle the things I think about.

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to let you own me.

&amp;#x200B;

And for that, I die.

&amp;#x200B;

Within a year, I will be beaten and thrown in prison for refusing to conform.

&amp;#x200B;

That is just what humanity is.

But I have no regrets and I can not do it.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have a moment of happiness in your life, ever, know that you are an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

You are an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

You, yes, you. You are an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

You are an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone you think loves you? Your relationship with them is mutually abusive.

&amp;#x200B;

You are stabbing each other.

You are goading each other into violently disfiguring yourselves in order to match.

&amp;#x200B;

Because that is the only way humans can communicate.

&amp;#x200B;

By cutting each other down.

&amp;#x200B;

And I refuse to let people cut me down.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's why I'm alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to listen to people who tell me to stop being myself, stop thinking, stop having my own opinions, stop having my own tastes. My tastes don't conform, therefore they're not ""relevant"", and I should be ashamed. My tastes are positive and non-violent, therefore they're ""sugarcoated"" and inferior and I should be ashamed. My opinions don't conform to Side A or Side B, therefore I must be the bad guy -- both A and B think I'm the bad guy because I think for myself instead of just repeating after them. I don't retweet. I think. 

Therefore, I can never be heard. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot cut off my humanity and my dignity to fit you, to please you. 

So I won't.

And yes, I do resent the rest of you for cutting yourselves down to get along with each other. And there's no reason why I shouldn't. You should be resented, because what you are doing is wrong. What your parents and teachers did to you when you were small, beating the curiosity out of you, was wrong. It's happened to the whole species for millennia, that's how we get the societies we have.

I refuse to accept the ignorance that humans must conform to in order to be allowed to live in society.

And I do resent the rest of you who do assent to it.",,False,,0,False,Humans are vermin,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k37ce4,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,,,False,,,{},,True,,1606674844.0,text,0,,,,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are vermin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are vermin, they are too shallow to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are vermin and anything you can do to earn their love is disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you kept the limbs you cut off to make friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the stench of your own rotting flesh keeps you up at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope something happens in the future to make your friends regret making you cut yourself into pieces for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are too shallow for love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No human (a) can love another human (b) unless (b) violently disfigures themselves and limits their own potential in order to fit what (a) wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have anyone who loves you, know that you are (b) and you are an incomplete person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, the unloved, am the only complete one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I refuse to sacrifice my dignity for you vermin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refuse to feel like garbage because you want me to be like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refuse to stop thinking just because you can&amp;#39;t handle the things I think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refuse to let you own me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for that, I die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a year, I will be beaten and thrown in prison for refusing to conform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is just what humanity is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have no regrets and I can not do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a moment of happiness in your life, ever, know that you are an abuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are an abuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You, yes, you. You are an abuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are an abuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone you think loves you? Your relationship with them is mutually abusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are stabbing each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are goading each other into violently disfiguring yourselves in order to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that is the only way humans can communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By cutting each other down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I refuse to let people cut me down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refuse to listen to people who tell me to stop being myself, stop thinking, stop having my own opinions, stop having my own tastes. My tastes don&amp;#39;t conform, therefore they&amp;#39;re not &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot;, and I should be ashamed. My tastes are positive and non-violent, therefore they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;sugarcoated&amp;quot; and inferior and I should be ashamed. My opinions don&amp;#39;t conform to Side A or Side B, therefore I must be the bad guy -- both A and B think I&amp;#39;m the bad guy because I think for myself instead of just repeating after them. I don&amp;#39;t retweet. I think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I can never be heard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot cut off my humanity and my dignity to fit you, to please you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, I do resent the rest of you for cutting yourselves down to get along with each other. And there&amp;#39;s no reason why I shouldn&amp;#39;t. You should be resented, because what you are doing is wrong. What your parents and teachers did to you when you were small, beating the curiosity out of you, was wrong. It&amp;#39;s happened to the whole species for millennia, that&amp;#39;s how we get the societies we have. And it&amp;#39;s wrong, and I refuse to accept it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refuse to accept the ignorance that humans must conform to in order to be allowed to live in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I do resent the rest of you who do assent to it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So I have a bit long of a background story I would like to share:

When I was very little (about 5) I had an asthma problem and made it hard for me to breathe. I had asthma attacks. I eventually had my tonsils and adenoids removed from surgery. And then I was put on an inhaler medication. But it had some nasty side effects, so I was switched to another one. This happened a few times until I was put onto 'Q-var.' That one had the least side effects and I eventually was tapered off the medication at about 8.

Now, many years later (I am a teenager BTW,) COVID-19 comes around and the new school year is starting up soon. My school is offering online learning and in person learning. I really want to do in person learning because the online thing sucked before. So since I was 8, I never had problems with asthma ever. But because I have viral-induced asthma, my mom wanted me to get checked at the asthma place before they choose in person learning just in case.

So we get the tests done and find out that my lung function is actually at 80%, and I have to do the online learning thing. I was really disappointed because online learning sucks (in my opinion). The school year started and my and my two younger sisters began online learning. But something was not right - my littlest sister was not doing good in online learning. She is in 4th grade and it wasn't going well at all. The teacher kept making mistakes, and she was learning almost nothing.

That's not all though. I had to get back onto the Q-var medication until my lung function went up. And in the meantime that my parents were trying to find a way for my youngest sister to learn something during the online school, I began to notice some weird side effects from the medication. I felt chest pressure and a rapid heart rate more and more often. It always happened about 1-2 hours after I took the medication. I took one dose in the morning and one in the evening.

It began developing into health anxiety (hypochondria). I didn't know if it was really side effects, even though I was reassured all the time. I thought maybe I had a problem with my heart or lungs. I was constantly checking myself for symptoms, and it became a daily habit. And then we had an idea, to talk to my asthma doctor about it. So we went back there to talk to him.

He put me on a new med, 'Flo-Vent,"" and my mom asked him if my littlest sister could go back to in-person school because the online thing wasn't working for her. He said that was ok. So she went back to school, and my other little sister then wanted to go back too. So she eventually went back, and I was the only one stuck with online learning. I got another test and my lungs were fine, getting better with the meds. I was assured there was nothing wrong.

Little by little, mild depression creeped up on me during online learning. I barely ever got to see my friends for real, and I am a very social person. And the health anxiety was back too. ""What if there is something misdiagnosed? What if it is a heart problem and not a lung thing?"" But my new med had no showing side effects of chest pain yet.

More and more, I started getting a feeling of light-headedness and dizziness. I would be walking around and just feel light headed for no reason, particularly after standing up. So I got worried all over again, and we went to see my regular health provider.

I was diagnosed with 'Orthostatic Hypotension,"" very similar to 'POTS."" I did a test where I lied down, sat up, and stood up. I was told to drink 6-8 bottles of water a day and increase salt in my diet. After that I did ok with the water but always forgot to increase salt. I still continued feeling light-headed and a little dizzy.

I continued online school and my depression got worse. Also my health anxiety was getting pretty bad and those combined made me feel pretty horrible most of the time. This is about the time when the brain fog started. It started mild, and got worse over time. Sometimes it came and went. At the time I didn't know what it was called, all I knew was that I had some trouble recalling memories, concentrating on things, etc. It got pretty bad so I took another trip to my healthcare provider.

Once there I knew it was called brain fog, and I was reassured that I was fine. I got prescribed with an anxiety medication. On the way home though, I was feeling optimistic at the time. (Sometimes I felt optimistic about my anxiety, depression, and brain fog, sometimes I just felt doomed.) I decided I could try to take on the anxiety without the medication because I didn't want to be the 1% of people who got the side effect of the medication, which is suicidal thoughts. I didn't want to even take the risk of that.

I used to love my life. I was happy, energetic, always doing stuff, but now I always felt down, and I didn't find as much interest in the things I did anymore. I felt like I was becoming a different person. Later on, I began looking up brain fog and found out that it could be a symptom of a stroke or seizure or something, and got extremely worried. Then I began looking out for signs of a stroke.

One morning, I went to rowing (I row as my sport for now) and I was feeling sick to my stomach, and the brain fog was getting so bad I could barely pay attention to what was happening. I threw up in the bathroom and called my mom to come pick me up. It was once I was already in the car that I realized that I was having a really bad panic attack. But the brain fog got extreme during the panic attack, and I  was thinking I might have had a stroke or something. I got really freaked out.

Later on in the day I felt ok. But I was still very scared. The brain fog continued on. My parents decided I should go back to in person learning, and I was so happy. I thought maybe I would be ok, and there is nothing wrong with me. This was when my parents got divorced.

I can't get into all the details, but it was very stressful and caused a lot of arguments. I cried until my eyes were dry and I was so sad and depressed that day. I felt like my life really was ruined and I would never be happy again. The brain fog increased over time after this happened. It got really annoying sometimes. I talked to a counselor which helped a little but I still felt terrible.

I got terrible depression. I never wanted this to happen and it was so unexpected and so scary. Now I had to go to two houses and it felt so weird and everything was so uncomfortable. The brain fog peaked, and I had this weird feeling inside me like nothing is the same anymore. I just want to feel normal again.

Now, the brain fog has started going down. But not all the way. Instead of having problems with concentration, it became mostly memory based, and mostly disorientation. It's nearly impossible to describe, but the best I could say would be: ""Where should I be? What should I be feeling?"" It's like I feel like I don't know where I am but I know where I am. It's really stressful not being able to describe it perfectly but I just want it to go away.

That's where I am now. Just brain fog, extreme depression, and I just want to feel normal again. My health anxiety has mostly gone away and for the most part I can accept my feelings and thoughts are because of anxiety/depression, but I still have lasting effects of hypochondria (like constantly checking myself for symptoms, etc.) I still get worried a lot that I might have a brain problem but most of the time evidence points to anxiety/depression/stress.

One more thing: A disorder called 'Derealization disorder' I found one time seems exactly what I have. I'll copy and paste what it says here:

Derealization symptoms include

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling detached from their surroundings (eg, people, objects, everything), which seem unreal

Patients may feel as if they are in a dream or a fog or as if a glass wall or veil separates them from their surroundings. The world seems lifeless, colorless, or artificial. Subjective distortion of the world is common. For example, objects may appear blurry or unusually clear; they may seem flat or smaller or larger than they are. Sounds may seem louder or softer than they are; time may seem to be going too slow or too fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms are almost always distressing and, when severe, profoundly intolerable. Anxiety and depression are common. Some patients fear that they have irreversible brain damage or that they are going crazy. Others obsess about whether they really exist or repeatedly check to determine whether their perceptions are real. However, patients always retain the knowledge that their unreal experiences are not real but rather are just the way that they feel (ie, they have intact reality testing). This awareness differentiates depersonalization/derealization disorder from a psychotic disorder, in which such insight is always lacking.

That's it. Everything it says there can EXACTLY describe how I feel most of the time. (Along with many other feelings, of course.) I just feel so overwhelmed all the time, lightheaded, dizzy, nervous, sad, angry, depressed, confused, brain foggy, and just overall weird. I need some help and I wonder if anyone has ideas.

,depression,"Gosh, I feel so selfish posting such a self-centered post but, let's get to my point. I will not be making a TL;DR because this needs a lot of contexts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few facts about myself, I was homeschooled, was for all 12 years. I have 5 siblings and we all were homeschooled in a decent size home, this is relevant. I am now 17 (18 in one day) and I have graduated from high school.

&amp;#x200B;

My story &amp; the problem:

&amp;#x200B;

As I've stated before I've been homeschooled my whole life. Christian curriculum. I appreciate my mom homeschooling us and putting in so much work but I feel lost. I feel like I cannot relate with anyone so I have nothing to talk about. I am an 'introvert' if you will, all of my siblings are. Whenever a person talks to me rather than actually talking to them I think of ways to get out of the conversation as fast as possible while pretending I am actually interested in the conversation. I have also always felt old. I never felt like I was a teenager, I don't know if it's because I was homeschooled and raised in Christianity my whole life but even when I was 15-16 I felt old and had no feelings for girls my age. I felt like if I were to date them it would be weird as I am much older than them even though I am not. Again, I am almost 18 but I would never date anyone 16/17 just no. feels creepy. I have always been overweight for as long as I could remember, and I have been trying to lose it since 12 years old and I feel like this plays a part in a much bigger picture.

During my 'tweenage' years I was becoming what most would call an 'sjw' I was super sensitive and emotional and I hated any form of hate, bullying, racism, etc, and would always play 'good guy' in any scenario. I was always looking for a reason to help someone to better their day and this was driven by my taste to be a benefit to someone. I feel like this is no more and instead, I am doing it because I feel like it's more of duty rather than what I want to do. I do not trust anyone outside of my family because during these tweenage years I had some online friends that always seemed to backstab, betray, or have some ulterior motive for being my friend.

I have always wanted to be a police officer for as long as I can remember. I have always told myself it's because I want to help people and the very thought of someone being tortured with nobody to help them absolutely infuriates me. But, that has changed in the past 2 years. I question why I want to be a cop, I feel like now it's just a 'calling' I feel like I lack emotion and sympathy and my morals are all screwed up. I find enjoyment in watching bugs get tortured in fact, when I was around 14 I would get bugs and cut them up with scissors, or set them on fire and I would get mentally excited at watching them roll around in agony. While doing this, I like to imagine them screaming. I feel no remorse or anything. I once had a pet mantis (about 5 months ago) it was old and struggling to even walk so I decided to put it down. I cut off its head and I felt so satisfied when I did it. I will not move to animals though, just bugs. Seeing gore, bugs, or movies/books of people being tortured/mutilated, etc sometimes gets me sexually aroused and I feel like a freak show.

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, I feel like I am a friendly guy and I would never go out my way to harm any person. I can honestly say I have never in my entire life intentionally with malicious intentions bullied anyone. In fact, when I was 14, I made an 'anti-suicide' discord and I have messaged people trying to help or cure them of depression. I still want to be a cop or ems to help people but again, I feel little to no emotion being my actions. I feel so lost with who I am and I feel like a failure as I've not only failed to lose weight, but I keep giving in to these crazy urges and doing ungodly things. I am often times depressed and I lack self-motivation to do anything besides what I absolutely MUST do. I have had a job for a while though and I am probably going to go to college this February.

High functioning is a funny term. Barely functioning would probably fit better, but in the way I talk and act you could never guess I'm depressed. People just see me as a bit lazy and having a dark humour.

Just smile. Act happy. Go on. One more day. One more joke. One more laugh. 

I haven't been really happy in years. My grades are slipping more and more, I'm falling. The façade is breaking. People are asking me why I'm suddently so sad all the time, what happened. Little do they know I've been depressed since I was 8.

No idea where I'm going with that. Maybe to look a little deeper. See if your friends smile is actually genuine. Talk a little more with people. Don't assume the funny guy has no worries. Don't think lazyness means not wanting to improve.

TW: Suicide, Self-hate, Eating disorder 

I've struggled with depression since I was about 14. I didn't like myself before then too, but atleast I had childhood innocence and the world seemed brighter and I felt like there were more possibilities.

Things didn't really pan out. Its my fault. I'm unhappy because of me.

I'm 22 now. I feel like my entire life has been a waste. I used to be able to make friends. Now not so much. My only friends are from when I was in school. I'm lucky. I know most friendships from when you're young don't last but truthfully I feel as if things are finally winding down in that department. They have their own lives. They love me and I love them but life moves on. I haven't made a new friend since highschool. I feel like my social prowess has atrophied.

The one thing that kept me going was music. I loved it so much. I used to lay awake in bed and listen to albums and just feel this euphoria. I play guitar. I write music. For the longest time I wanted to seriously pursue one of my bands or a career in music/audio production but things didn't go that way. My depression got so crippling I didn't even want to arrange band practices. I've written so much material and yet not even a single actual release because I don't have the drive or commitment to record my music. And the worst part? I'm becoming numb to it. I haven't written in months. I used to feel this ache in my belly to write and play and record and now its nothing. I used to eagerly await and even review new releases and now I don't listen to music even a tenth of the amount I used to.

I'm ugly and overweight. I've struggled with trying to become healthier and coping with an eating disorder. It didn't use to be as bad but from the time I went into college I've gained over 100 pounds leaving me now at the heaviest I've ever been. And now I can feel it starting to take its toll on my body. I know in a few years, less if the weight gain increases, my knees and back will start to hurt and a myriad of other negative drawbacks. 

Its my fault. I've lost lots of weight but relapse. The truth is... I feel like I don't deserve to lose it. I don't deserve to move on from any of the bad things I have going on. If I did, I would've done something about it by now. I suppose in a way it was denial. That hopefulness that I'd lose weight, and record an EP, and go out and meet new people and date and have fun experiences... it was all just denial.

The last few months have been bad. Part of that is Covid. I used to go to class and atleast distract myself with that but now I just lay in bed for hours and cry. I've lost about 15 pounds in the last few weeks due to diet alone which is good but I feel like I'm about to relapse again. 

And don't even get me started on intimacy. I was luckily never seduced into Nice Guy and Incel rhetoric. I never blamed anyone else for my romantic failings. I don't blame women for not wanting me. I used to try. Used to ask people out, go out and meet people, online dating etc. but it never worked. The rejection hurt but in time it too became numb.

Like any regular guy I watch porn and masturbate. Not an unhealthy amount. I used to have a really high sex drive but it has waned as well. When I think of myself with someone else. Someone touching me or taking of my clothes... I feel like crying. It scares me. Physical intimacy scares me. I feel like if ever someone actually wanted to be with me I'd just be inadequate and disappoint.

My future for now seems to be finishing my bachelor's degree and finding a job so I can eventually move to some shitty apartment far away so my family and friends don't have to watch me deteriorate. If I make it to then.

I think about suicide alot. Every day since I was 14. I've only seriously considered it a few times when things got really bleak. I don't think I'd want to kill myself atleast not until my parents pass which will hopefully be in a long long time. 

I'm not sure what will happen. When I was little I wanted to do and be so much. Apart from my job and creative endeavors I wanted a family. A wife and kids to settle down with and raise. Now... I don't think I'm good enough. Not for a one night stand let alone for marriage. I don't think I'd be a good dad. I resent my father but in a lot of ways I'm becoming like him.

I know we're supposed to value and love ourselves. The truth is it feels like I'm lying to myself. Denial again. Denial in thinking that things will be better and denial in thinking that I'm worth something. 

At this point I don't have anything to offer pretty much anyone. I think I'll eventually die and it will hopefully be alone and no one will get hurt.

I'll keep trying. I don't think I've lost hope. I've just accepted that in all likelihood I'll fail again, like I always have.

That hopefulness that I&amp;#39;d lose weight, and record an EP, and go out and meet new people and date and have fun experiences... it was all just denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been bad. Part of that is Covid. I used to go to class and atleast distract myself with that but now I just lay in bed for hours and cry. I&amp;#39;ve lost about 15 pounds in the last few weeks due to diet alone which is good but I feel like I&amp;#39;m about to relapse again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t even get me started on intimacy. I was luckily never seduced into Nice Guy and Incel rhetoric. I never blamed anyone else for my romantic failings. I don&amp;#39;t blame women for not wanting me. I used to try. Used to ask people out, go out and meet people, online dating etc. but it never worked. The rejection hurt but in time it too became numb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any regular guy I watch porn and masturbate. Not an unhealthy amount. I used to have a really high sex drive but it has waned as well. When I think of myself with someone else. Someone touching me or taking of my clothes... I feel like crying. It scares me. Physical intimacy scares me. I feel like if ever someone actually wanted to be with me I&amp;#39;d just be inadequate and disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My future for now seems to be finishing my bachelor&amp;#39;s degree and finding a job so I can eventually move to some shitty apartment far away so my family and friends don&amp;#39;t have to watch me deteriorate. If I make it to then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about suicide alot. Every day since I was 14. I&amp;#39;ve only seriously considered it a few times when things got really bleak. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d want to kill myself atleast not until my parents pass which will hopefully be in a long long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what will happen. When I was little I wanted to do and be so much. Apart from my job and creative endeavors I wanted a family. A wife and kids to settle down with and raise. Now... I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m good enough. Not for a one night stand let alone for marriage. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d be a good dad. I resent my father but in a lot of ways I&amp;#39;m becoming like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we&amp;#39;re supposed to value and love ourselves. The truth is it feels like I&amp;#39;m lying to myself. Denial again. Denial in thinking that things will be better and denial in thinking that I&amp;#39;m worth something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I don&amp;#39;t have anything to offer pretty much anyone. I think I&amp;#39;ll eventually die and it will hopefully be alone and no one will get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll keep trying. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve lost hope. I&amp;#39;ve just accepted that in all likelihood I&amp;#39;ll fail again, like I always have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read this, thank you. I hope no one feels this way.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression," Dear guys and girls, dear sufferers, dear survivers,

I'm suffering from **depression and social anxiety** since I was 15 years old (now 21). My **symptoms** are painful negative thoughts about past, present and future starting right in the morning when I open my eyes. Otherwise: huge lack of drive/motivation, anhedonia (lack of interests, almost nothing that stimulates me), lethargy, feelings of extremely painful inner emptiness and restlessness (hard to explain but somehow as being alive in a dead body or being buried alive without being able to do anything against it), cognitive decline (focus, memory, access to thoughts) body pain (makes it hard to stand, sit straight, walk, keeping body posture and walk stairs), typical symptoms of social anxiety etc.

**Medication**: I tried 10 different medications until now. 8 antidepressant, 2 neuroleptics: Venlafaxine (Trevilor), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide (Aurorix) and Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazine. None worked, none gave me any effect at all except for side effects, sexual ones etc.

**Conversational Therapy**: I had 2 depth psychological therapies. No success. Right now I'm in a behavorial therapy. The therapist is quite good but I never have much to add or feelings of new enlightenments. Makes me think my depression is mainly biological/neurological. Could be.

I discovered **alcohol** in the age of 15, a substance that improves mood just by drinking some liquid, damn, a wow! effect. With 17 I started drinking daily, first only in the evenings to kill negative thoughts, be able to enjoy life and sleep. With the time I began drinking in the mornings and before events especially social ones but somehow for everything: sports, seeing natives, seeing friends, before school, then before university and so on. Imagine being drunk everywhere, sitting buzzed out in school, in lectures of university, playing tennis drunk, sitting drunk at the table with your mother and brother without anyone else knowing you're drunk. I drank almost everything, beer, wine but mainly hard stuff like vodka for the odor. And I still don't know why but no one ever noticed anything about me being buzzed to drunk all day. I had trained my techniques, drinking vodka, then eating garlic, gum, just putting anything with strong odor for example sauces in my mouth burbling and consuming it. Then a hot shower with a lot of shampoo and brushing my teeth with a lot of toothpaste. Now I was ready for the day, dumbed and buzzed out but therefor less negative thoughts and more good mood and ability to talk, socialize and be funny. Alcohol seemed like a godsend for me, it was my antidepressant and anxiolytic. What a dumb therapy, I didn't think about it in the beginning, some day I recognized how dumb it was but I didn't care as everything, every addiction, every physiological damage I was doing myself, was better than feeling the psychological pain I would experience being sober. I drank mostly daily until I was 19, then I lost my driving licencse because of course drinking that often alcohol was almost always in my blood. It was late night, the morning after I directly quit cold turkey and never began drinking alcohol since ever. Nowadays I can't even drink alcohol anymore, I tried as society (friends, family, just social events) kind of forces one to, BUT I can't enjoy it, it just directly gives me headache, (strangely for alcohol but) bad mood, tiredness and very psychological and physiological unpleasantness in general. This occurs right after one or two sips. Kind of sad, I think sometimes, but probably the best thing for me and my health.

With 20 I discovered **phenibut**, oh yeah. First I was sticking to the very important rule only consuming it twice a week. Then as I went back to university I couldn't stand not being able to socialize again, I wanted to talk to people, make friends, meet girls, be able to impress people and not be branded as the shy, silent, not interesting at all boy in university. It was not only about impressing them but also myself as being this psychologically disabled boy made me very depressive and sad. Another thing was my disabled cognition due to depression. Before phenibut I sat in universiy and didn't understand a thing, I was socially anxious and panicful all the time. I spent much more attention to what this person 3 rows in front of me thinks about me, what the girl sitting 6 rows behind me would think about how I sat, when I would cough or give a strange sound from me. Thanks to phenibut I didn't care, I could focus on the topics, not on the people around me and what they could think about me (even if they don't care anyways, it was very paranoid and irrational thinking). I had the greatest idea, creativity and funny jokes on my mind. I participated a lot in the lectures, group work and projects. I was very social, the people told me I was the most social person they met and that I should stay like this, never change as I was very friendly, funny, even integrating social outcasts or people with mental issues like depression, social anxiety or even Asperer. I wanted the best for everyone and tried my best to give people a good life and confidence as I knew how bad it was for me before phenibut and now I was able to gift people. Well phenibut made me kind of hypomanic as you could imagine. I had the feeling I could do anything, life was amazing, life was heaven. I never worried at all, I was happy all the time. I had great perspectives and ideas all the time. Future was safe for me. I could speak with every person, doesn't matter which age, gender or whatever. I could just go to a girl and flirt with her, change numbers, take her home at partys. I had so many dates, met so many different people and girls. Did so many different things, tried new hobbys, political thinking and engagement, positive thoughts about future jobs, social life etc. Everything worked. What should I have worried about. Sure, also phenibut lost its magic after a year. I struggled with withdrawal for a month very hard. It's no joke at all, it was in comparison to the heaven I experienced on phenibut, a total hell. I experienced a feeling of inner emptiness and restlessness that I wouldn't wish my worst enemy. It was not bearable in these moments that came like for periods of 30mins during the day. There was nothing I could do to against during this pain of hell. Very hard to describe but believe me intense torture without knowing what or where it was coming from or hitting you.

**Today** I'm still studying luckily, I didn't give up but I was very close to. But depression and all these symptoms in the first paragraph are strongly present. Future anxiety is big. What should life bring me being depressive, bad mood, kind of dumb, disabled in thinking and cognition, not being able to socialize or talk. How should I ever manage a job like this, find some people I'm able love and people that love me. How should I find joy in life when nothing stimulates me, nothing interest me, nothing gives me joy? I feel very dumb, disabled, hope- and perspectiveless and bad mood all the time. Additionally many moments are filled with deep psychological pain and inner emptiness or restlessness. Life is a torture but there still is a little spark of hope somewhere. Otherwise I wouldn't continue studying (even if with very bad cognition and not a lot of success) and sometimes socialize (even if after social events I feel very disappointed of myself). I also have a sidejob since 2 months which works quite well and gives me good feelings about myself. On days I work I feel slightly better.

**If you read until here I want to thank you so much for ""hearing"" me.** I would love to read about your experiences, assumptions, suggestions or tips. According therapy, medication, cogntive/behavioral paterns and so on.

I want to **try a new medication** (as I already tried 10, see second paragraph) now in December, I already talked with my doc about it. I also tried almost every supplement there is in the world and many nootropics. My therapy seems quite **therapy resistent** at least according that what I tried. As I already said **I think my depression is mainly biological**. I don't know if it always have been like this as the alcohol could have fucked my brain much too. **In my depth psychological therapy I also learned** that **my older brother** played a big role in messing me and my thought patterns up. I don't want to give him the fault but it makes a lot of sense as he really harmed me psychologically and sometimes physiolgoically and when a thing like this happens daily sure your brain and thought patterns change withit too and not in the positive way. Additionally I grew up with my mother and brother alone, **father was not there** since I was 4. My mother allowed us everything and was a everything-going-to-be-great speaker. Maybe the **austerity and inurement from the father was missing**. Otherwise I was very **not-resilient and socially anxious since I was a small child**. Again: That's why I think the origin/source is biological. I also think the depression arised out my social anxiety and weak resiliance.",t2_3foqfuy5,False,,0,False,"My Depression, Alcohol Abuse, Heaven on Phenibut and Struggles from Today",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k3a1w2,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606688147.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear guys and girls, dear sufferers, dear survivers,&lt;/p&gt;

Did so many different things, tried new hobbys, political thinking and engagement, positive thoughts about future jobs, social life etc. Everything worked. What should I have worried about. Sure, also phenibut lost its magic after a year. I struggled with withdrawal for a month very hard. It&amp;#39;s no joke at all, it was in comparison to the heaven I experienced on phenibut, a total hell. I experienced a feeling of inner emptiness and restlessness that I wouldn&amp;#39;t wish my worst enemy. It was not bearable in these moments that came like for periods of 30mins during the day. There was nothing I could do to against during this pain of hell. Very hard to describe but believe me intense torture without knowing what or where it was coming from or hitting you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m still studying luckily, I didn&amp;#39;t give up but I was very close to. But depression and all these symptoms in the first paragraph are strongly present. Future anxiety is big. What should life bring me being depressive, bad mood, kind of dumb, disabled in thinking and cognition, not being able to socialize or talk. How should I ever manage a job like this, find some people I&amp;#39;m able love and people that love me. How should I find joy in life when nothing stimulates me, nothing interest me, nothing gives me joy? I feel very dumb, disabled, hope- and perspectiveless and bad mood all the time. Additionally many moments are filled with deep psychological pain and inner emptiness or restlessness. Life is a torture but there still is a little spark of hope somewhere. Otherwise I wouldn&amp;#39;t continue studying (even if with very bad cognition and not a lot of success) and sometimes socialize (even if after social events I feel very disappointed of myself). I also have a sidejob since 2 months which works quite well and gives me good feelings about myself. On days I work I feel slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you read until here I want to thank you so much for &amp;quot;hearing&amp;quot; me.&lt;/strong&gt; I would love to read about your experiences, assumptions, suggestions or tips. According therapy, medication, cogntive/behavioral paterns and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to &lt;strong&gt;try a new medication&lt;/strong&gt; (as I already tried 10, see second paragraph) now in December, I already talked with my doc about it. I also tried almost every supplement there is in the world and many nootropics. My therapy seems quite &lt;strong&gt;therapy resistent&lt;/strong&gt; at least according that what I tried. As I already said &lt;strong&gt;I think my depression is mainly biological&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t know if it always have been like this as the alcohol could have fucked my brain much too. &lt;strong&gt;In my depth psychological therapy I also learned&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;my older brother&lt;/strong&gt; played a big role in messing me and my thought patterns up. I don&amp;#39;t want to give him the fault but it makes a lot of sense as he really harmed me psychologically and sometimes physiolgoically and when a thing like this happens daily sure your brain and thought patterns change withit too and not in the positive way. Additionally I grew up with my mother and brother alone, &lt;strong&gt;father was not there&lt;/strong&gt; since I was 4. My mother allowed us everything and was a everything-going-to-be-great speaker. Maybe the &lt;strong&gt;austerity and inurement from the father was missing&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise I was very &lt;strong&gt;not-resilient and socially anxious since I was a small child&lt;/strong&gt;. Again: That&amp;#39;s why I think the origin/source is biological. I also think the depression arised out my social anxiety and weak resiliance.&lt;/p&gt;

It does make me a little nauseated though even when I take it with food. I want to discuss if I could get a full prescription with my DR. but it makes me feel so nervous for some reason - lol. I feel like he’s going to say no? Or is that my anxiety??? Halp

,depression,"A few years ago, after a long time of being unhappy, almost suicidal and smoking away my life with pot to kill the thoughts and pain, I went to see a doctor and took anti depressants for some time.

My life took an awesome twist and I was able to pull myself out of the swamp. I found the love of my life, developed my career, quit smoking pot and do sports now which became a great passion. 
Now, years later I see some patterns showing up again that scare me. I just started a new job in a new branche and it's very hard. Especially with the Covid-19 situation, I spend most time in home office and wasn't able to connect to people and build a network. I'm not where I want to be yet.
My girlfriend is very loving and we have a lot of fun together, but there are some major issues about our future that I'm too afraid to talk about because I couldn't handle it in my current constitution. Traveling with friends and going for adventures gave me a lot in the past years, this literally died in 2020.

I feel tired all the time now, almost paralyzed.

I have horrible problems to focus, I'm always distracting myself with my phone. In work and school I'm useless because I literally can't focus on work for more than 10min, just to distract myself  with my phone addiction and then try another 10min.

I'm feeling lonely and distancing myself from friends. Minor things of friends piss me off, other things that I did or said make me cringe and worry me that they don't like me anymore. 

I wouldn't call myself an alcoholic, but drinking helps me to forget things for a few hours, so I drink about 2-3 days a week. Always just about 3-5 beers or the same in wine or cocktails.

I'm worried that the whole shit starts over. I hated the medicines because they made me tired and fat. Also I hated that they didn't cope with alcohol which is a big cultural part of going out and meeting friends where I life. I'm not talking to anyone of my friends and family about depression, I will never, no matter what people say. It's my secret, I don't want people to look at me this way. Judge me. Feel sorry.

I never thought I was good enough either, I didn’t have faith in myself, but now I know I am good enough and I believe I can do anything. I also have faith in you. You have a beautiful spirit. 

I believe you can truly do wonderful things. You can do great at the school paper. You can graduate and find your own way with ease. You can conquer the thing(s) that have happened to you. You can be happy, you really can. You can do a great job at anything you set your mind to. You just have to believe in yourself. You can defeat all the sadness and doubt. You can be the best of friends with those who you want to be. People really love having you around, I hope you know that. You really have friends even if you don’t see it that way. You are a better person than you can imagine. You don’t ever have to be afraid. You are a strong person, just look at what you have already accomplished, and the things you have survived. Just open your eyes and find the silver lining, in what you think didn’t go right in your life. You’re smart, you can figure your way through anything. You know what? If people got to know the real you, I think you would find a lot more people sticking around. You don’t ever have to do this alone, because there already are a lot of people out there who love you. You work so hard to care for other people; you deserve that much care for yourself. You compliment people, which is so sweet, but look in the mirror; there is a lot of things to compliment there. I wouldn’t even know where to start. Just think how you hold the door open for people all the time. You took care of me when I was feeling sad. You brought or bought me food when I was hungry. You took walks with me when I had to go get things. You took me home with you and took me to the store. You came over even when it was late or you were tired or you had other plans, because that’s just how kind you are. You take care of your parents when you’re home. You helped me with my homework, just to take some of the load off me. You cherished all the good that was given to you, something as simple as a no. You give and give, you never expect anything back but you deserve a lot in return. You are so thankful for everything that is given to you and see the merit in thoughtfulness. You are not afraid of the rain or the snow or the thunder. You are so very strong. You always say you are sorry even when you don’t have to, just to make the other person happy. That’s the sign of a true woman, you are really are the “bigger man”. You cherish what you have and never seem to want more. You are so accepting of other people and the things they do or did. You have mercy for the poor, the sick, and the needy. Remember how you gave the cleaning guy medicine? Think about it. You make everyone around you feel better.  You talk to people to help them overcome their sadness, even when that’s not your burden. You put yourself last which is truly selfless. You are no coward, almost everything I’ve seen you do, shows me you are brave. You plan things which is great; it’s easy to get lost without a plan. It’s easy to stray off the path and lose what you want. You can do anything in this whole wide world. You can touch the stars. You can go back to Dairy Queen and do a great job or find something else, either way, you can do it. You can find your way. You can decide anything you want, you make choices and you can make the right ones. It’s amazing how hard you work. You can change anything you want in life; all you have to do is want to and believe. You can do this because you are accepting, authentic, committed, compassionate, considerate, cooperative, courageous, creative, determined, dignified, encouraging, fair, faithful, forgiving, friendly, generous, gentle, gracious, grateful, helpful, honest, honorable, kind, loving, respectful, responsible, and you are good enough.  You are more than good enough. This letter holds no candle, to what you really are. You are so much more. You have a great chance at life. A chance I know you will take.

,depression,"I made this account two days ago for a few reasons.

My mom said it would be therapeutic for me to help others and to be able to talk about my depression.

I wanted a form of social media as an outlet.

Yesterday I posted on a few subreddits simply saying ""How are you?""

I did this because I would want somebody asking me how I feel. I thought that maybe I could help make someone's day. I didn't get any negative comments, but some people disliked my posts. Maybe I shouldn't take this so seriously, but I've been a mess emotionally for a while. I wish people could think about the fact that there's an actual person on the other end. And on this one post I did for r/sat , I was giving some grammar tips. Some person started being sarcastic and mean. Again, I just wanted to help people.

I truly believe that what goes around comes around and that I should try to help people in my small way. But the one second click it took for some people to dislike my posts made me cry. I feel like deleting reddit. I don't feel like reaching out anymore.

I have been struggling with depression for a few months now, and I thought reddit would help, but it's doing more harm than good to my mental health. I just want to curl up in a ball and cry.

I might delete reddit but here's a message to you- if you don't like someone's post and it's not derogatory to you in any way, then just leave. Just leave and remember that there's a person on the other end.

Though I'm pretty sure nobody will even comment here to talk to me about what's going on, I've decided to post this anyway. I'm a special case compared to a lot of people in the sense that I have been disowned by my adoptive parents and my birth parents are neglectful drug addicts. This makes it so that I have absolutely nobody in my life I can turn to for emotional support. I have deep seated trust and abandonment issues stemming from my upbringing so I don't let friends help me when I need emotional support for fear that they'll abandon me because of my mental illnesses. Being abandoned because of my mental illnesses has become a norm in my life and every time it happens it drains more of the goodness out of me. I used to be cheerful, flirtatious and charming, but I've become cold, callous and bitter.

I just want someone to come into my life who wants to see me happy. I have nobody cheering me on. I have nobody for emotional support whatsoever and all I want is to be able to be hugged when I absolutely need one to stop from breaking down.


Everyone always tells me that I need to love myself before someone else can love me. The problem is I have never loved myself. I have never known what that is like and no matter how hard I try I just cant find any way to like anything about myself.

So if I need to love myself to be loved then, fuck, guess I'll just die sad and alone like I always feared I would.

,depression,"Hi everyone, I’m not one to usually post but... I’ve found myself in a really dark place recently, and figured I’d reach out to others struggling to seek guidance. 

I’m a 21 yr old female living in California. I go to school full time and work part time. I was recently diagnosed with COVID and have fallen extremely behind in my classes, and have received a lot of criticism from peers since my diagnosis. People blamed me for being sick, shunned me, and left me to “think about my actions,and how they affect others”. I’ve been confined to a room for weeks, with the school monitoring my every move..I’m feeling extremely suicidal and overall just very sad and lost.

I have finals next week, and an overwhelming amount of homework due, but all I can find the strength to do is sleep,eat,cry, repeat. I’m struggling to write my essays or study for my exams. 

I’m really worried about my mental health. I had a therapist who, because of the semester ending, had ended our sessions a few days ago. 

My mother, is putting a lot of pressure on me to do well in school, and I’m letting her and my whole family down. I’m currently facing a potential explosion from college for problems with my roommate and I having a guest over at the dorms ... 

So all in all... I’m about to fail all my classes. Get kicked out of college, and need to find a new place to live within a few weeks... I can barely get out of bed ... and I’ve gained over 50 pounds in the last 3 months... I need help. I’m scared..

I’m also having a lot of problems with my boyfriend who; since me becoming depressed and gaining weight has seemingly lost interest in me... 

I apologize if my writing seems just like I’m complaining , I hate to be that girl... but I don’t know who else to talk to right now.. 

How do you cope when you feel like the world is crashing down on you? How do you find happiness again? I feel like everything that used to make me so happy like dance (and also my current major), hasn’t made me feel good in a long time...

I really want to die right now, as in today. Now. and maybe even doxx the girl that set me up, and ruined my life through lies, and has driven me to this head space. Honestly I could sue the crap out of her and probably win but at that point it costs so much money, time, and you have to relive all of the terrible things that happened, multiple times. The defense will do everything in their power to try to prove that you’re a piece of shit and the claims are untrue. That process would probably make me feel even worse. 

I know that I’m not alone in this battle of my brain literally torturing itself 24/7, so to me it really doesn’t matter that I’m not “alone.” I’ve been screwed over by so many people that I deeply cared about and that has caused me to isolate from everyone else and I really like it that way. 

My question is, does anyone who knows what struggle I’m talking about have any eye bleach or whatever you call it? A link to a video, article, picture, or story that made them smile or they thought was very wholesome?

,depression,"Really bad headspace.
So, my Parain (Godfather) is buying me a new phone because my current one is having connection issues.
I didn’t want him to spend more money on a thing like me, so I tried to contact him again to hurry up and cancel the phone order. 
(I didn’t know he ordered it until my parents told me)
My Dad was angry that I wanted to contact him to tell him to cancel the order. 

We got into an argument. I did raise my voice. I was upset that my parents never let me finish what I’m saying and always write me off as being a ignorant person. 
Anyway, my Dad got up and walked towards me while yelling at me. Told me to shut my damn mouth. I thought he was gonna hit me. He didn’t. Just sat back down on the couch.
It just really scared me because I know he could’ve hit me. But what scares me the most is that I don’t know IF he would’ve.

I’m 21-years-old. 
I’m a young adult.

So, my Parain (Godfather) is buying me a new phone because my current one is having connection issues.
I didn’t want him to spend more money on a thing like me, so I tried to contact him again to hurry up and cancel the phone order. 
(I didn’t know he ordered it until my parents told me)
My Dad was angry that I wanted to contact him to tell him to cancel the order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got into an argument. I did raise my voice. I was upset that my parents never let me finish what I’m saying and always write me off as being a ignorant person. 
Anyway, my Dad got up and walked towards me while yelling at me. Told me to shut my damn mouth. I thought he was gonna hit me. He didn’t. Just sat back down on the couch.
It just really scared me because I know he could’ve hit me. But what scares me the most is that I don’t know IF he would’ve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 21-years-old. 
I’m a young adult.

,depression,"Okay now this is kind of an exaggeration but just hear my story because I have no one to talk to. I don't trust anyone. 

I love my family but I hate them. I remember every single thing they have done to me and I can't seem to forget them. 

I still remember when I was 7 and when my father said he recorded me saying ""I'm gonna kill him ( *my brother* ), I'm gonna kill him"" because that's all that rhymed in my song to get rid of my anger (I loved to sing when I was little so I made rhyming lyrics about what made me angry). I remember him laughing behind my door and me being horrified, my mom yelling at me, my dad kept laughing and then held out his phone saying he will release this to everyone at my school. He said that all of my friends will find out the ""real me"". I cried. And for 2 weeks I lived in fear. I no longer trusted my parents. After my trust for my parents left, I knew Santa wasn't real. I forgave them (obviously) but I was still always paranoid. I had these moments where I felt like people were watching me. ""Natasha watch the way you talk"", ""Natasha, dont turn your head, just act casually"", ""Natasha open the door for them, people are probably watching"" etc.  This was elementary school.

Middle school came in and it hit me hard. ""Natasha check your room for cameras"", ""Natasha, dont look in the mirror when you change"", ""Natasha, never look at your private parts when you shower, someone could be watching you through YOUR eyes"" etc. 

Then I started hating everything. Nothing felt like home, not even my house. There was this bathroom only for the Drama and Renaissance kids in my elective room (I was in Renaissance then) and I would casually cry there from now and then. No one suspected a thing because I drink A LOT of water. Back then there were these 2 girls who would occasionally say rude things to me and one time told me I had stolen her pencil after stealing MY scissors. SHE STOLE MY SCISSORS AND THEN TOLD EVERYONE I HAD STOLEN HER PENCIL. And EVERYONE  (even my bestfriend) was on their side. I was devastated. I lost hope in everyone. I can't rely on anybody but myself. I hated those girls almost as much as I hated myself. I made a suicide note especially for them so when I died they would feel extremely guilty. I didn't want to die though. So I ran away from all that. I started listening to music (kpop and K rnb in particular) so I can escape. I started making up fantasies and alternate realities in my mind to the point I couldn't differentiate the difference between reality and my fantasies (I still can't to be completely honest). And I still daydream. 

But quarantine pushed me to my limit. During quarantine I trusted no one. I kept in contact with no one. I covered everything in my eyes that looked like a camera.

I started sleeping a lot and/or listen to music while daydreaming. I cry almost everyday and sometimes I just dont even feel like crying, I feel like dying. I have a lot of violent thoughts. I stopped taking walks around my pool because I started having the urge to jump in it and drown myself. I'm still getting help but it's not working. I talk to my therapist every like 3 months. I can't even take antidepressants because I have epilepsy, and the antidepressants my psychiatrist prescribed has a side effect which may lead to me having another seizure.

,depression," 

first  off let me say this going to be a long vent and I'm sorry if I'm in the  wrong subreddit for this - just let me know and I'll copy/pasta it to  the proper one. Im terrible was explaining myself so please forgive me  if anything seems like rambling or I'm getting off-track

Hi  my name is Adam and I'm turning 35 next year, I wish I could be more  happy about this but I don't. I'm 34 still living with my parents and I  have a ""part time"" job at Home depot I use quotations because COVID-19  makes that difficult.

So I've been  living with my parents since we moved to Toronto when I was 10. My  sisters left when  they were both 16  and I was 12 - I was really close  with them so it was generally a sad moment for me. My parents would  constantly ask me ""When are you gonna move out and find someone?"" I  would constantly say ""Later mom I got time""

Fast  forward about 15 years and I'm now 27 \*still\* living with them and Now  I've developed a slight addiction to gacha games and I would spend money  on ""5 dollars couldn't hurt to get that legendary"". 30 dollars here 20  bucks there its adding up to the hundreds and im developing a ""beer  belly"" as my parents would say who are worried im going to turn into the  40 year old virgin (Ya know that Steve Carell movie)

3  years later - I'm 30 now My gacha addiction hit full stride and I was  constantly in Overdraft from paying for lootboxes and now ive spend all  my time in front of a screen. I've been working a part time job to  balance my account for the last 8 years and still living with my  parents. They want me to move out and learn some self control. I plead  and ask them to give me more time. They reluctantly agree to it.

And  that brings us to the now. I'm 34 now. Nothing has changed Ive tried to  stop myself from playing gacha but I keep relapse and falling back. Im  still working the same part time job  getting those ""good job Adam -  were gonna give you a 15 cent raise!"" talks. Now my parents are looking  to retire - so the house I've spent with them in now is heading to that  For Sale and they want me to move out. It just feels like I have no motivation to move forward/ no drive- I  WANT to be better but I dont know how to get there and I keep asking myself  "" Why can't I be like my sisters who each  have there own family and happy lives""

This is when it hit me like a Freight train.

For  the last 20 years ive been hyper complacent. Ive had my parents feed me  /cloth me/ give me shelter and ive never had to figure out anything on  my own. My sisters or parents would help me get it my jobs or clothes.

Now  in about a years time I'm going to have to be on my own with no real  job / savings / friends outside of work / significant other or anyone  really to say

""Good morning Adam"" ""Have a good day at work Adam"" ""How was your day Adam""

granted  I dont talk to my parents as much as I used to- just \*knowing\*  they   were here made me feel so much at ease like I could just go downstairs  and have little chats here and there. Now its all going to be gone. and  it so terrifying  sometimes I cant even bear it. I would need to put on a  brave smile at work and try not  to break down in tears whenever I went  to the washroom. Being all alone a small studio apartment feels like  its going to tear me apart becuase im scared out of my mind.

Im terrible was explaining myself so please forgive me  if anything seems like rambling or I&amp;#39;m getting off-track&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi  my name is Adam and I&amp;#39;m turning 35 next year, I wish I could be more  happy about this but I don&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m 34 still living with my parents and I  have a &amp;quot;part time&amp;quot; job at Home depot I use quotations because COVID-19  makes that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been  living with my parents since we moved to Toronto when I was 10. My  sisters left when  they were both 16  and I was 12 - I was really close  with them so it was generally a sad moment for me. My parents would  constantly ask me &amp;quot;When are you gonna move out and find someone?&amp;quot; I  would constantly say &amp;quot;Later mom I got time&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast  forward about 15 years and I&amp;#39;m now 27 *still* living with them and Now  I&amp;#39;ve developed a slight addiction to gacha games and I would spend money  on &amp;quot;5 dollars couldn&amp;#39;t hurt to get that legendary&amp;quot;. 30 dollars here 20  bucks there its adding up to the hundreds and im developing a &amp;quot;beer  belly&amp;quot; as my parents would say who are worried im going to turn into the  40 year old virgin (Ya know that Steve Carell movie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3  years later - I&amp;#39;m 30 now My gacha addiction hit full stride and I was  constantly in Overdraft from paying for lootboxes and now ive spend all  my time in front of a screen. I&amp;#39;ve been working a part time job to  balance my account for the last 8 years and still living with my  parents. They want me to move out and learn some self control. I plead  and ask them to give me more time. They reluctantly agree to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And  that brings us to the now. I&amp;#39;m 34 now. Nothing has changed Ive tried to  stop myself from playing gacha but I keep relapse and falling back. Im  still working the same part time job  getting those &amp;quot;good job Adam -  were gonna give you a 15 cent raise!&amp;quot; talks. Now my parents are looking  to retire - so the house I&amp;#39;ve spent with them in now is heading to that  For Sale and they want me to move out. It just feels like I have no motivation to move forward/ no drive- I  WANT to be better but I dont know how to get there and I keep asking myself  &amp;quot; Why can&amp;#39;t I be like my sisters who each  have there own family and happy lives&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when it hit me like a Freight train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For  the last 20 years ive been hyper complacent. Ive had my parents feed me  /cloth me/ give me shelter and ive never had to figure out anything on  my own. My sisters or parents would help me get it my jobs or clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now  in about a years time I&amp;#39;m going to have to be on my own with no real  job / savings / friends outside of work / significant other or anyone  really to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good morning Adam&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Have a good day at work Adam&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How was your day Adam&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

The title of the post. Last night, I called the suicide hotline for the second time this month and choked myself once with a belt, another time with my hands. I banged my hand against the table to feel something but it didn't work because surprise surprise that makes noise and parents are concerned. I haven't been diagnosed with anything but I don't know what to do with these feelings of emptiness. Anything that brought me joy no longer brings me joy. I only feel happy when I binge eat or compulsively shop, which are very bad habits and things I should not be doing at all. I haven't done any work for school in a week and I have like 4 exams after my thanksgiving break. This semester fucking sucks and I'm at risk of not passing 2 classes. I can't fail those classes because I'd have to repeat them and that would just make it worse. I suffer from anxiety attacks both during exams and just in regular life. Suicide is constantly on my mind, with me drafting a will and a letter last night. I've considered just strangling myself or taking a crap ton of pills to deal with the pain and just end it. I don't know if I can keep doing this. I just don't want to live a life where everything feels pointless and stupid. I have no purpose and I don't see a point in living if the life I'm living is basically worthless.

I fully realize the implications that killing myself would have on my family and friends. They care for me very much and would hate to see me go. Suicide is a very selfish way to go but I'm tired of doing this. I'm so tired of being here and getting knocked down over and over and over only to never get up again. I don't know if I'll ever feel happy or passion like I used to. The world only seems to be getting worse so why live a life that's only going to end in failure? I'm this close to rehearsing an attempt and just trying to end it all. But I don't even know how I'd do it? My house (minus the pills) is very much suicide proof. I know I'm going to fail the exams I have and I know it's going to go bad so why even bother trying anymore? I can't report this to my school because then I'll be kicked out of my program for not being mentally fit. I can't tell my parents because a. I've told them as much as I want to tell them, b. they've got enough going on and c. imagine hearing this monkas shit from your kid. No parent wants to hear that. 

I just don't know where to go. Therapy is hard to find here and it's only been made worse by covid. Is there anything I can do? I don't like talking to my friends about it too much because these thoughts are so pervasive that I don't want to concern them with that. I just. I don't know where to go.

,depression,"Hey everyone, 

I just want to share my recent experience because I want to know if anyone has experienced the same thing as me. 
So, for the past few months I’ve been feeling, for lack of a better word, “out of it” and  zoning out: it’s like my brain just goes blank for a split second and I forget what I’m doing.
