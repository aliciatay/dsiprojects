###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

,SuicideWatch,"We're constantly told that everything will get better with exercise, medication and therapy. Sure, this does work for some people, but it does not magically fix the situation which caused the depressive symptoms. Yes, with treatment you can improve your situation and get your life back on track, but it's not a quick fix.

However, treatment for Depression is fucking expensive which prevents people from seeking help in the first place.

The overwhelming majority of us are just depressed and suicidal because of the monotony of our daily lives. Doing shit that you don't want to do, in order to get money for doing the shit you don't want to do, then getting a few hours to do what you want to do until you have to repeat the cycle the next day. You just feel stuck and helpless.

This path is really enough to piss you off: School/College &gt; Job/Career &gt; Marriage &gt; Kids &gt; Retire &gt; Die.  Fair enough, we need to earn money somehow and you can't just sit in your mum's basement drinking mountain dew and playing video games, but when you realise that you will be working from 18 to 64, you get the thought of ""what's the fucking point?"".

You may have dreams of being great, but you need to possess certain traits to be successful and be quite lucky to have that superstardom that we all dream of. A lot of us got fucked over by genetics and our birth circumstances (shitty family, poverty), and this makes it infinitely harder to reach these dreams because of how harsh the world is when it comes to your appearance. So if you dream of being a singer or a model, good luck if you lost the genetic lottery. I'm not saying that it's impossible, but it's very hard if you don't look a certain way and for every success story, there are 1 million+ failures. 

As a young child you have zero responsibility, and have a very naive innocent mind. You see the world in bright colours with sunshine and rainbows, but as you grow older you begin realising that the world is a shitty place and you are just another hamster in a wheel. A slave just like everyone else.

I feel like being depressed and suicidal is a natural response to the world that we live in, and we're constantly sold a solution to carry on being miserable.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 17 and I live in Japan. Life is becoming too harsh recently. High school is too painful for me and I can't endure it anymore. I've been suffering from social anxiety since I was 12. I barely made a friend at high school but my classmate began bullying him and he just dropped out. I couldn't help him. Fortunately I'm not bullied at school but I no longer have someone to talk with.

These days I go to bed early trying to fall asleep but sometimes I can't sleep at all. In the morning every part of my body hurts, but I tried to pretend to be normal because I didn't want to dissappoint my parents.

Yesterday, again I couldn't sleep at all. And when my mom came to me and woke me up, I told her I don't want to go to school. My mom was enraged and she desparately tried to make me go to school. But I shut up and didn't do anything. She called me lazy and disappointment, and told me she didn't want me to be her son.

Until I entered high school, everything was too easy to me and I didn't have to study at all. I passed my high school entrance exam with ease, my parents and grandparents praised me for working hard but I didn't even study. But things they teach at high school today is much more difficult and that doesn't work anymore. I know I have to work hard for the next exam, but I don't know how because I never worked hard before. I used to believe I was intelligent but I realized I wasn't. But I can't admit my mediocrity, and part of my brain still thinks I'm good enough. My parents, grandparents and cousins expect a lot from me but I feel like I'm going to dissapoint all of them. If I fail my college entrance exam, they will ridicule me saying I'm stupid.

If I continue refusing to go to school, I will fail grade and get another one year to suffer. If I drop out, that means I screw up my whole career. In my country, dropping out from school is huge disadvantage when applying for a job. But more than that, I want to somehow overcome my society anxiety and enjoy high school like others. But I don't know how to overcome it. To me, it feels like suicide is the only viable option to end the pain.

,SuicideWatch,"Now disclaimer I do not hate Indians at all themselves, I just hate being Indian and the stereotypes that come with it. I can feel my pure inferiority as I type it. I amount to nothing and what's the point of carrying on if I have to keep living like this. If reincarnation is real as I have been taught my entire life, then please let me born as black or white, just anything other than Indian. Even Pakistani would be fine with me. Bangladeshi, Nepali, Sri Lakan whatever

I was born and raised in the west from an Indian family. They showed me little to no love growing up, abused me mentally, emotionally and physically, brainwashed me, denied me anything I wanted and kicked me out of the house at a young age. I couldn't even count the amount of times my father has told me to jump off a terrace in my life. My brother on the other hand was pampered and loved beyond anything else.

The racial bullying got so bad at one point and they did nothing about it. i can remember it like it was yesterday. Every time I would go anywhere it was always ""ew whats that smell"", ""it stinks here"" despite me having showered and wore cologne that day, for those who don't know they were targeted jokes making fun of how Indians smell. ""Go back to your shithole, we shower in this country"". Among other things

Kids would come up to me outta nowhere slap me in the face and say ""hit back Gandhi"", and they were always in groups. too. They would tell me ""I'm not Indian, I'm not stupid"". ""he's stupid, he's indian."" Couldn't go to the bathroom, as I would always get jumped and ganged up on, the kids would make jokes about how Indians shit ont he floor and how I'm ""not allowed in the bathrooms"". Now none of them would do it 1 on 1, I actually sent a kid to a hospital once, shattered his orbital cause I couldn't take after he had shoved me down in the bathroom and called me ""curry boy"" it but all his friends jumped in and I also ended up in the hospital as well. I always fought back when I was jumped, but to no avail. Admins didn't take it seriously so I'm on my own.

And the worst part? This shit is not only condoned but encouraged. Racism against us Indians/Asians in general always flies. Even mongoloid asians r defended more than us. Imagine if it were a black, or hispanic person getting bullied like this, all races would have a issue and it'd make headlines. Even other South Asians would bully me. For some reason pakistanis don't get half the negative stereotypes we do by others, so they would always tell me about how backwards I am because I ""worship cows"" and everyone else would also make fun of me for that. A group of boys threw lemonade in my face and said ""drink this cow piss, hindu"". And the thing is, they defend it by bringing up these stereotypes are based in truth.

Drinking cow piss is a part of hinduism, and almost half of India does shit in the streets, they'd say. Always in class they would say ""do u shit on the floor?"" ""does ur mom shit on the floor?"" and I'd be called currymuncher and dothead all the time too. Another thing was when they'd make all the 7/11 slurpee jokes and Indian scammer things.

Ik what sum of u may be thinking. ""it's those alt right trumpie white people"" right? No. Surprisingly almost every single incident I had was racism from black people. I don't hate black people at all, and I have some black friends, but 99% of the racism I have faced here is from black people, and they get away with it perfectly fine cause it's just this country's logic that only racism towards them won't be tolerated.

Also not to mention being Indian is a turn off for most girls as well. Even pakistanis have better luck here than we do. I been rejected time after time cause I'm Indian, for no other reason, ladies even tell me to my face that's why.

God I can't tell you how much school I've missed trying to avoid it too. I'd get beat up and called racial slurs almost every day. The streetshitter jokes got so annoying ad it took a toll on my mental health. I may have been wasting my life staying home and playing video games instead, but it was better than going to school

The last straw was when I was in a public bathroom not too long ago. I saw one of my old classmates from before the virus struck, he immediately recognized me and said ""I thought i smelled curry"" and then he caught me by surprise, took my neck and locked me in a rear naked choke while yelling all kinds of slurs.

I felt so fucking pathetic, how'd I let that happen to me? I cried myself to sleep for nights after that and just decided I'm gonna end my life. I'm going to wait till after christmas, but I know where my dad keeps his pistol. I'm going to take it, put it in my mouth and point upwards before pulling the trigger and ending it all. I hope if reincarnation is real that I will never EVER be born in this ethnicity again ever.

I have made several plans and at least four serious but half-assed attempts so far. Always chickened out at the last minute for some reason. The thing is I don't want to inconvenience my family. They might have become indifferent to my plight over the years but they have never been outright unkind or hostile towards me. And they have enough problems of their own without having to deal with the aftermath of my death like the social stigma, possible police investigation, feeling unnecessary guilt, etc. I just don't want to burden them with my shit. So I am going to try to resist for as long as I can. 

But that doesn't change the fact that I am constantly thinking about ending it all. I have lost all motivation to do anything to improve my life. I feel hungry but can barely force myself to swallow the food. I haven't left the house in months except once for a doctor's visit. I struggle to get out of bed and brush my teeth or even look at myself in the mirror. I used to devour books and stories, always eager to read. But now I haven't completed a book in years. I always start and give up after a couple of chapters. I can feel myself becoming more and more stupid every day. I curse myself for not being able to complete simple tasks and feel like a failure because I'm the one responsible for letting it get this bad. I've isolated myself from everybody and basically burned all those bridges by being unresponsive to any texts or calls. I repress my emotions in front of my family and close friends and then resent them for not digging further. But it's not like I can articulate why I feel so bad all the time. Every time I try to say it aloud, it sounds so lame and something that can be solved if I just try harder. I am the only one who can save myself and I'm just not up for it. So I'm stuck in this horrible limbo. 

It's been getting worse lately. I got so agitated because I read a journal entry that I had written on my 23rd birthday and nothing has changed in my life. I regret not killing myself then. I've wasted so much time thinking that I would get better while not really doing anything to make it better. Reluctance and procrastination have somehow doomed me and saved me. Doomed me because I let fear of failure stop me from going after my dreams and building a good life. And saved me because all I do is make plans and fantasize about killing myself without any concrete plans to follow through. 

So I made a list three days ago. Stuff that I need to take care of before I take the definite step. Writing a clear, concise note, deleting all my social media, erasing personal stuff, listing financial details that my family might need access to, reducing the effort they might need to expend on cleanup afterwards, etc. I thought it might help me if and when the time comes.

All day I sleep or play games, or sometimes on the shit days I just sit and stare at the ceiling. I fucking hate it, I’m not doing anything fun or productive. I never do any of my hobbies or anything anymore, it’s just pain and distraction of that pain the whole day trough. I used to have a great passion for music, I have barely listened to music, let alone touched an instrument.

And I can’t look in the mirror anymore either, every time I do I see someone that I fucking hate, personality and appearance wise. I’m afraid of showering and shaving, because every time I look down I see a body that doesn’t fit. My face is super masculine and I can’t stand it.

My thoughts are either occupied by dumb shit or depressing things. All my life I have felt shit and depressed but now I’m living alone and it’s all worse.

,SuicideWatch,"I attempted to suffocate myself with a plastic bag but I stopped. 

I am a college student in NYC, 21 female. I just moved here from the middle of US 3 month ago, but I haven’t made any friends. I cheated on all my assignments and I haven’t finished any class recording, so now I’m failing on tests. I couldn’t find any internship that I’m suppose to find. I can’t go back to be with my parents because of the pandemic. Even if I go back, I’m just trapped there and lonely. 

My boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago during his trip to visit me saying that he cannot be my rock, he can’t be that person for me. I went through similar thing a year ago around the same time where a friend (roommate) told me that we aren’t good fit together. They both once told me that I was their favorite or very important to them. But they still can’t stay in my life. This hit me hard. 

I’m just trapped in my apartment in memories and pain. 

I attempted then, a year ago. I called the ambulance myself and stayed in hospital for a week. I was in psych ward for a few days. The only thing I found out is that, I can just lie my way out of this. I was so sure that no amount of medicine or therapy can help me achieve a healthy life again. 

Yesterday, I had my passport by my side, and my parents number and email written on a paper. I had my suicide note written the day he broke up with me. I was ready to go. I will text 911 first to report my suicide and then text him and my parents a note and my suicide note. I had everything ready. 

I pointed a knife on my rib cage for so many times during these few days, feeling exhausted for everything. But when I look down, I see my body, and on my bed I can just see him and I having a sweet time together, then I just couldn’t stop crying. I changed it to a plastic bag because I don’t want it to be messy. 

I ended up calling the suicide help line. 

[Edit: I called the help line because I realized, if for any reason, I could just have him back promising that he will be there for me for ever. I would be having enough drive to finish my work, and have continued my life. If I have a loving partner by my side, and I have my rock, I would still want to live. Although impossible to happen right now, there are situations that I would like to live in. That’s when I thought maybe I should call for help. ]

I was connected to a lady for 1hr before the line broke. I was talking to her about how my boyfriend told me among his girlfriends I was his favorite. 

When the line broke, I just put the bag on my head. I was counting to 30 something when my phone rang again, the lady from help line called me again. This time we talked for another 1.5hr. She asked me some really good question to lead me to think about the choice. 

I then proceeded to call my mom. Magically, she knew something is wrong and she started apologizing for not being intimate when I was young and stuff. I have got the apologies or recognition I always wanted. I felt much better. 

I wrote my ex boyfriend a message saying that I’m thankful for him but I’m finally ready to move on. Then went to sleep at dawn. 

But here I am again. Not seeing any way to be out of the situation, wanting everything to end for good, thinking that’s definitely the easy way out. I don’t see a point in continuing this life I had.

On a scale of 1-5, 1 being the least likely to commit suicide, I’m still not a 1. Maybe not going to be a 1 for the rest of the eternity. 

I want to buy a gun, so that I have freedom at hand whenever I needed.

Update Nov30 night:
I called again to the suicide line and talked with a lady for 1 hour. I was feeling unbearable with my memories again. I tired myself out so that I can sleep.

,SuicideWatch,"I felt abandoned and filled with hatred from parents that never were even together. I was just a booty call baby. It didnt bother me because my grandma raised me but once she got sick and died, it left me alone. I hated them so much that i didnt even know it was hate i had for them

I tried to make things work and Clinton Jones and Toya Mack (yes im name dropping because they never deserved the title mom and dad from me) after my grandma passed while they tried to save face (from guilt that they werent in my life and didnt raise me like they were suppose too but i guess they thought giving u something every now and again made up for it). I regret it to this day EVER getting close to them. After my grandma died, i didnt know this myself, but my hatred for them for everyone starting building. I did things wondering why did i do this? It was to hurt them and especially hurt myself. I never wanted to live especially after my grandma died. Whenever Clinton came around at that time all i remember is him being a narcissist, sarcastic, asshole that was jealous of me and my grandma relationship. Probably why he stole my stuff she bought for me as well as some of her things. Yea i didnt forget. Just like yall didnt forget the shit i did to you all.

It was to hurt them and especially hurt myself. I never wanted to live especially after my grandma died.

,SuicideWatch,"Lemme just walk through this, so you guys kind ""get it"":

Earlier this year I moved out of an abusive household, and i got a big apartment expecting to have people to spend time with. That didn't come to fruition, shortly after moving out I started going to therapy which my mother barred me from going to before moving out, I was diagnosed with Borderline personality and OCD, and I started medication that helped with the effects of it. August 28th 2020 rolls around. My girlfriend of 6 months breaks up with me. Citing my mental illness being too much for her to take on right now with her starting college up. I've heard this before from a couple people, relationship or not. I cry for a couple days and move on, I'm fine. A few days later I get into a car accident, which according to the cops was actually a setup to steal my car. Upon attempting to give them my information, their dog jumped out the window and took a chunk out of my arm. This is not fake, it's in my post history, and the wound picture is [here.](https://i.imgur.com/u2YbtvT.jpg). They fleed shortly after their dog attacked me. I got medical attention, I was fine. I somehow, through both of those things, was still chipper, made jokes about the arm thing, was fine. I hadn't been hugged and allowed to cry since february when I last saw a friend who I emotionally resonated with. (I still haven't been hugged and allowed to melt down. I don't blame anyone since there's a fucking pandemic but it's just kind of unbearable.) Fast forward a couple weeks/months, the cops ignore my case until nearly a month and a half later, I get a name for the person who's dog attacked me and who fleed the crime. I approach a lawyer about a consultation for a civil suit against the man, for the accident and the mauling. He says that the defendant most likely wouldn't have enough money to cover the legal fees alone so he told me to drop it, I got a second opinion, same deal. 

At this point I notice therapy isn't really working because the issues I'm facing are incredibly large ones. 

Flash forward a bit more, I attempt to file a restraining order on my mother, who abused me physically, mentally, and emotionally since I was 6 months old (according to a witness). 

This restraining order is denied on the basis that ""I had not lived in her house in the last 3 months"" or some inane bullshit. She abused me for two decades and she apparently gets off scott free because I was 3 months too late to file. I'm heartbroken. This is around the time the medication stops working. 

I notice that I can start hearing, when there is no sound in my house, a voice in my head telling me to kill myself, and various ways to do it, and how fucking pathetic I am and how I am a burden on those that I love (this gets reinforced a lot, and I let it happen so that they leave and I can't hurt them anymore). I tell my therapist about this, we run a quick diag and assess it against my previous diagnosis. I am diagnosed with High Functioning Schizophrenia. I am heartbroken. It feels as if this year has taken everything from me it can. But it continues to get worse. In a somewhat petty move, my twitter gets removed for telling someone who was harassing my friend [""suck my fat fucking balls""](https://i.imgur.com/VybXMPk.png), which twitter cited as harassment, I had already been struggling with loneliness, as I never get to see my friends, and the ones who I can see don't like me anymore for one reason or another, with no reason given, I'd even lost my best friend who I've known for 8 years, who ghosted me, with no reason given, since August. I'm lonely, I'm heartbroken. And now my 6 year old twitter account where I'd collected a large group of people I loved to interact with on the daily was gone. I thought I had lost everything. 

A friend who I made back in September who I really felt understood me and I felt I understood them, tonight, got fed up with my bullshit, rightfully so, and has decided to exit my life, my mental illness and the rut it created was too much for them. I understand. I even pushed them to go because I knew I was no good for them, they pushed back until I was almost abrasive about it, at which point they left, which I agree with and understand, I said goodbye, apologized for any heartache I caused them and that was that. 

TL:DR, these last 10 or so months have taken the last of my sanity and I cannot bare to do this shit anymore. I deleted the social media apps I use to interact with people from my phone and my computer. It's time for me to go, I'm exhausted, and with no resolution in sight I can't bear to do this anymore man. 

Apologies if any of this is unclear or poorly put together. im tired. im going to go to bed now. im probably going to get the necessary materials later this week. gun, silencer, nice place to park my car that won't scar anyone. I plan to call the cops right before I take my life, put my last will and testiment somewhere public so people can know what I wish, and then take my life somewhere pretty. i want to harm the least amount of people as possible with my passing.

I've had so many people in my life claim they care about me, but seem to start complaining or disappear off the face of the Earth the second ""caring"" about me becomes inconvenient.

I'm not expecting anyone to do every little thing for me or go above and beyond to ""help"", but there's been so many times where I'll try to confide in someone only to get dismissed or reminded that their time is too valuable to be spent on me.

Okay, cool, so why even claim you care and/or ""want to help"" in the first place? Just be fucking honest and say you only ""care"" about me on a surface level. Don't claim you care and then can't be bothered to spend so much as 10 minutes of your time to listen to my woes.

The thing that pisses me off the most is that I have ""sacrificed"" things for some people that claim they care, even if it's only my time, and it's usually a lot longer than just 10 fucking minutes, sometimes it's a full fucking day. I'm starting to find myself not caring about anyone any more, and I don't expect the same from anyone else, least of those that claim they ""care"" oh so much.

My best friend of 6 years and the love of my life replaced me with someone else and admitted that she fell out of love with me 2 years ago when I went into a dark place mentally and started to show my pain (aka when I started 'being myself'). For 2 years, I continued thinking we were bonded for life. I cared more about her than I cared about my own life. She promised me 'paradise' and promised to take me away from my narcissist parents. She made promises about how she would take me to another country and marry me. These promises were the only reason I did not kill myself and the only reason I had the motivation to do well in college for want of a better life. A few months ago, she revealed that it was all a lie. I still love her. I refrain from being outwardly angry for fear that she will cut me out of her life altogether. It is so painful, but I have no other reason to live. She was that reason. In the past 2 months I have attempted suicide twice but I hesitate and break down out of fear before I am able. However, I am slowly getting the courage to go through with it every day. I have a plan, I have a reason, but I don't have the courage yet. I will have the courage before the end of 2020.

I truly do not have any other reason to be alive. No motivation to do anything now that I am going to be alone. This is the biggest betrayal I have ever felt in my life, and the funny this about it is that I still care about this person who has gouged my heart out and stomped on it.

A few months ago, she revealed that it was all a lie. I still love her. I refrain from being outwardly angry for fear that she will cut me out of her life altogether. It is so painful, but I have no other reason to live. She was that reason. In the past 2 months I have attempted suicide twice but I hesitate and break down out of fear before I am able. However, I am slowly getting the courage to go through with it every day. I have a plan, I have a reason, but I don&amp;#39;t have the courage yet. I will have the courage before the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly do not have any other reason to be alive. No motivation to do anything now that I am going to be alone. This is the biggest betrayal I have ever felt in my life, and the funny this about it is that I still care about this person who has gouged my heart out and stomped on it. Everything was taken away from me and I do not expect I will be on this earth any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do not say, &amp;#39;You can&amp;#39;t kill yourself because your friends and family will be sad!!!&amp;#39; That does not apply to me. Also, please do not suggest I just find someone else to be in a relationship with. I am deathly anxious, autistic, and my mental illness worsens with every disappointment I face. There is no hope for me now. That was it.&lt;/p&gt;

My children. Love the dogs.  I’ve struggled with mental health issues my entire life. Been seeing some type of psych since I’m about 11.  Been on all sorts of meds for depression/anxiety/ocd/no polar.  Been hospitalized.  

By all accounts from the outside looking in, my life is great. I’m a professional with a doctorate (staying vague about my profession).  Job is high stress.  My wife’s job is also full time and high stress.  Add Covid and virtual learning for 3 young kids into the mix and it gets pretty overwhelming.  And when I say I love my family, I truly mean it.  

I think of suicide often. Multiple times a day. I just feel so lost and stuck and can’t imagine a future that I’m in. There are times I am convinced that my family would be better off (there is a sibling on my wife’s side who is uber wealthy. Like private planes 10 homes type of $.  They don’t help us financially and we don’t ask. But I’m convinced (hopeful) they would pick up the tab if I ended my life).  Can’t get life insurance for at least another year because of my history.

I’ve never made an attempt. I’ve always been good about reaching out and letting my wife know I’m getting bad.  

I guess I’m just curious - how much is too much.  There are days that it dominates my thoughts. There are others where is just there in the background. I just don’t want to upset my wife again, and I also don’t want my therapist ringing any alarm bells. So would love people’s thoughts about the thoughts.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi SW,

I made an account for this so, I hope you can help me. If I did something wrong, let me know. 

TLDR; I have never done anything because I'm scared of everything. I had my first ever violent episode yesterday, now I'm scared of myself. 

I'm in my early 20's. I never learned how to drive because it scared me, and then when my dad tried to teach me he ended up giving me an even worse phobia, I can't even get in a driver's seat now without going catatonic. I never went to college, I'm trying to apply now just for the sake of leaving my parents' house cause they're both really bad for my mental health, but applying makes me panic. I quit my job that made me miserable, then covid hit, and I'm scared to send out resumes.

I honestly don't know what to do. Everyone's advice is ""its just anxiety, work through it!"" or ""do it anyway!"" but it doesn't really work when your fear response is freezing. Or distracting yourself so you don't need to feel things. Work through it doesn't work, and yes I have tried, it just always ends the same way. It's even more frustrating because I know once I do it it'll feel good. 

So many mental health articles begin with ""So I'd just graduated college, gotten married, and have an amazing job but I still have depression!"" I have nothing. What's the point in keeping on when I just freeze in the face of making my life any better? I just want to not exist, cause I barely do right now.",t2_6in7o7pr,False,,0,False,Trying to get Help,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,True,t3_k4g3zd,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606835896.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi SW,&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

i am tired of it all.. it's clear that i should be wiped from the face of this planet. and i am not lying, i have shown the chats to my therapist and they all haunt me... no one can lie and say it didn't happen, i have all of the chats. here are the hurtful things people have told me, a few lines are from the same person:

if you can't do it one last time then next time won't be your last time.

you're a sinner

if you were really raped then you wouldn't have told anyone

how were you raped? you're only 14...

he's my friend. i hope you die in your ocean of lies

hey levi, i think it's in your best interest to know how crazy sheri really is and the possibility she's a witch

if you keep being like this then you'll never go to heaven. it's up to you

imagine what dad would think of you now

you are so, so stupid to let him do that to you

if you're pregnant then i will be very disappointed in you

sometimes you make me not want to call you my daughter

i will NOT help you. only god can help you.

you're scaring me

you should be nicer

you say i love you too much

my friends are afraid of you dude

maybe you're the demon

maybe 9/11 was your fault since you're so obsessed with it

ngl it was funny when you cried

my mom thinks  you're satanic so we can't hang out anymore

you're like this because you don't pray to god enough

mental illnesses like schizophrenia aren't actually a thing. you just need to ask god for help

imagine what god thinks of you right now

you are a disappointment

i can't love you when you're like this

you don't say i love you enough

(my second attacker) i always wanted to do this to you since we first met but trent was always in the way

i would kill you right now if i could

get off your high horse and watch your mouth. i was raped in the past too so don't speak to me as if i don't know what it's like. kendricke has been my friend for years and we love him. he is like any other human being who makes mistakes. i believe he can change. i choose to see the light and i hope you do someday too. but you won't. so walk away. leave. NOW.

wow, how can someone get raped twice in their life?

kendricke is like family to me. would i let him be around my future wife and kids? yes... because it's the future and he can change.

if she hurts herself over this then we are NOT responsible.

this is her fault. it's on her tbh

the world would be a better place without your inability to forgive and love

i will not go to the doctor. look at what the doctor did to dad and you. so only god can help me. if my time is coming soon, then it is. or you aren't praying for me enough. that's why you're sick in your head, because you don't talk to god. maybe that's why i'm sick too. you don't talk to god enough. you don't love god enough.

maybe levi gave you the demons. why do you hang around him? praying for you both.

i'm sure not all your friendships ended at the demise of a sexual abuser.

you're too nice

i do it to you because it's funny. i will not console you. sorry but i will not get hurt with you over this.

I just found out I have a therapy appointment at 3. I've been trying to catch up on school work since 7 am (it's past 12 pm rn). But I can't get anything done because my mom keeps calling me and coming to my room to start shit.

We had to call the school because the website wasn't working. We got it fixed, so I went to my room. Then my mom knocked on my door, asked if I was upset, I said no, she said I was ""full of shit"" and walked away before I could even say anything. I texted her and asked her why she said that. She knocked on my door and said ""why did I say what?"" AS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. Then she started getting upset and said ""You have a therapy appointment at 3"" and walked away again.

While she was on the phone with the school she kept hanging up on them and calling me LITERALLY every 10 minutes to see what I was doing. I kept falling asleep because I'm so fucking tired, and when I told her that she said ""You should be doing your schoolwork"" How the fuck am I supposed to do that when the website IS NOT WORKING???

I have had 3 anxiety attacks this morning. I do not want to go to my appointment because I don't know if I will even be able to talk with how anxious have been all day. I haven't showered and now I have to get school done and get ready before 3. I can't fucking do this anymore.

I'm sorry if this didn't make any sense. I just want someone to see this. I don't know.

,SuicideWatch,"I'll try and keep it short. Me and my ex were seeing each other less and less because of my new job and we fought more often about the simplest things. But I loved her deeply and with all my heart. We just slowly grew apart because our lives, professional and personal, were just heading in different directions. We tried to make it work but it just wasn't happening.

One day, I come home to find a note on the kitchen counter. She told me she was leaving me for someone else, someone she went to school with that she met on Tinder but she said she wasn't cheating and hadn't actually done anything with him. She just felt a better connection with him. I nearly cut my wrists then and there but cried my eyes out instead and threw a chair against the wall in anger and made a huge hole.

Them, that Friday, I decided to try my best to forget about her and got black out drunk. I remember going to the bar and then going back outside intoxicated, but I eventually found myself standing at a bridge that went over a little lake that was plenty enough deep. I decided that now was the time and that instead of continuing to feel sorry for myself, I'd just save myself the misery and end it now. I climbed up and stood looking down at the water for a few moments before jumping in. Let me remind you all that it was chilly weather where I'm at and was jumping into probably 40 degree Fahrenheit water.

I don't remember floating or being underwater though. The next thing I remember is a guy with a bald head and big white beard like Santa looking down at me trying to wake me up, with another guy around my age next to him. After coughing up water for a few moments, I saw I was on land and immediately started to break down again. The guy around my age had went in and pulled me out, and he and the bald guy dragged me back up on land. I looked around and saw a small crowd of people had gathered by this point and I kept crying. The next thing I saw was ambulance lights and a few paramedics and cops came over and helped sit me up. I told them I tried to kill myself and gave them the whole story of my breakup and all of that.

The bearded man, whose name was Henry, sat on the other side of me and just listened to the story as I kept crying and just didn't know what to do with myself. He said that he lost his wife two years ago and was in a similar situation, considering ending his life and not wanting to be without her. I also spoke with the police and, in a rare act of kindness not often seen these days, one of the officers drove me home. I threw up as soon as I got inside my apartment and went to sleep.

So that's my story. I haven't tried to do it again since, but I'm still not in a great place. I don't hate her, by the way, my ex. I don't.

&lt;p&gt;Them, that Friday, I decided to try my best to forget about her and got black out drunk. I remember going to the bar and then going back outside intoxicated, but I eventually found myself standing at a bridge that went over a little lake that was plenty enough deep. I decided that now was the time and that instead of continuing to feel sorry for myself, I&amp;#39;d just save myself the misery and end it now. I climbed up and stood looking down at the water for a few moments before jumping in. Let me remind you all that it was chilly weather where I&amp;#39;m at and was jumping into probably 40 degree Fahrenheit water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember floating or being underwater though. The next thing I remember is a guy with a bald head and big white beard like Santa looking down at me trying to wake me up, with another guy around my age next to him. After coughing up water for a few moments, I saw I was on land and immediately started to break down again. The guy around my age had went in and pulled me out, and he and the bald guy dragged me back up on land. I looked around and saw a small crowd of people had gathered by this point and I kept crying. The next thing I saw was ambulance lights and a few paramedics and cops came over and helped sit me up. I told them I tried to kill myself and gave them the whole story of my breakup and all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bearded man, whose name was Henry, sat on the other side of me and just listened to the story as I kept crying and just didn&amp;#39;t know what to do with myself. He said that he lost his wife two years ago and was in a similar situation, considering ending his life and not wanting to be without her. I also spoke with the police and, in a rare act of kindness not often seen these days, one of the officers drove me home. I threw up as soon as I got inside my apartment and went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s my story. I haven&amp;#39;t tried to do it again since, but I&amp;#39;m still not in a great place. I don&amp;#39;t hate her, by the way, my ex. I don&amp;#39;t. I recognize that she wants to be happy, and that&amp;#39;s all I ever wanted her to be.&lt;/p&gt;

I never felt homesick but now it feels so weird. I can't sleep at night and the only way I go to sleep is when I stay awake for too long. I had so many friends in Highschool and ever since I moved I've kinda lost in touch with them but I still follow them on Instagram. Whenever I see their stories of them hanging out and having fun I just feel so depressed and I regret moving. I don't have any student loan debt because my dad pays for my tuition fee ( no we're not rich)which is what makes it so worse. I feel so guilty because I haven't told him I failed some of my classes. Since i have a poor GPA , I'm at that stage where I would be kicked out of Engineering. I'm on a academic probation right now. The only thing stopping me from ending it is my mom. My mom loves me so much. When I was about to move Canada , she was half hearted about it. Eventually she was fine with it since I wanted to go. Now I wish I never moved at all. I can't stop googling about easy ways to die. Each time I think about killing myself, I think about my mom and how would she feel. Why is it that eventhough I have a lot of people who love me so much , I still feel lonely and depressed.  I mean I know some of you may be going through worse stuff than this or this might look like not a big deal. Trust me I know. When I was in Highschool I heard about students killing themselves and I thought why would anyone do that and laughed about it. But now it just hurts so bad. I feel like I'm such a disappointment. My dad even sold one of his houses so that he could pay for my tuition fee and I feel like I'm failing him. This is also another thing that stops me from doing it because all those things he did for my education would became useless and even in death I would fail him. I mean I thought about talking to a therapist or something then i realized I'm too broke and too insecure to talk about it to someone I know. The only reason I'm posting this on reddit is because I can stay anonymous. I was also in a long distance relationship with a girl. I loved her so much and marry her but even while I was talking with her I was scared of my life the whole time. She loved me so much but I threw it all away because I was a coward. I ghosted her for months and I didn't break up with her properly. I feel like I push everyone away everyone who cares about me. I was once a very extroverted person but now I don't even feel like talking to my mom or dad or even my brother.  All i do is wake up, attend some zoom lectures , do some assignments and study. But I think I won't be able to stop myself from doing it if I'm required to discontinue from Engineering. I wanted to be a Engineer since highschool but now I just wanna pass my courses. I was very eager when I moved to Canada but now I just wanna die. I keep telling to myself that if I ever get the opportunity to die in an accident , to take it because that way my parents won't think I killed myself. I don't know what to do to stop feeling this way. If you've read this far, well thanks. I just needed to tell this to someone.

,SuicideWatch,"Incident happened 4 years ago when I was 24 (I'm a lesbian by the way). That night I was hopped up on liquor and cocaine so my memory of what happened is muddled. Note that the coke/liquor combo makes me ""loose"" and overly confident as well. I basically turned into a frat boy on that stuff. I'm clean as a baby's ass now.

Anyway what I know is I befriended a girl called Brie who is now a good pal of mine. Brie and I got on remarkably well and stuck together like two peas in a pod at the bar for the night. I wasn't rock solid if the energy was flirtatious or friendly but I flirted and she was receptive so I pressed forward in the flirty direction. She did say to me point blank her long-term boyfriend was at home watching their dogs and that she was not gay. 

My response to that statement was pretty much ""yeah yeah"" and rolled over it. I kissed her on the top of head, put my arm around her shoulder and probably carried right on verbally flirting with her though I could not tell you a single thing I actually said. She didn't express discomfort from my memory and if she said no or pushed back, I know without a doubt sober or not, I would've stopped right then and there. But I do recall being hit with a feeling of dread at the end of the night that I stepped over the line. Sure enough as we're all going home, my other lesbian friends gently tell me I was being ""intense"", ""aggressive"" and repeatedly calling the girl cute despite her clear statement of straightness and boyfriend.

A few notes:

* I feel like I'm a worthless dangerous offender. I'm wholeheartedly sorry for my actions. I think about that night a lot and I don't think I'm a good person. I want to think it wasn't done out of malice but benign people don't ignore and go past red lights like I did when she told me about her boyfriend and straightness for example. The moment those words left her mouth about her boyfriend/straightness is when the benefit of the doubt for me ended. Benign people don't behave in ways their friends describe as ""intense"" or ""aggressive."" The guilt is eating me up and I throw up at least twice a day. 

* I live in NYC and the city itself is big but the lesbian community runs quite small still. I'm terrified that stories and bad reputations are going to follow me. It's a selfish concern but one I have nonetheless.

* We didn't kiss this incident specifically but all the times I've kissed people in the past are circling my mind. I didn't seek explicit verbal consent to kiss people every single time. Instead I tried to infer off non-verbal cues and those are not as rock solid. There's room for error with that. When people pulled away from the kiss, I'd stop for sure though. I could've done better with my process of getting consent.  

* Brie and I are cool and always have been. After my friends told me their take on the night, I sincerely apologized to Brie but she herself seemed completely fine. I believe her minimal reaction to the night made me not consider it a big deal myself for a long time.

When people pulled away from the kiss, I&amp;#39;d stop for sure though. I could&amp;#39;ve done better with my process of getting consent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brie and I are cool and always have been. After my friends told me their take on the night, I sincerely apologized to Brie but she herself seemed completely fine. I believe her minimal reaction to the night made me not consider it a big deal myself for a long time. Reflecting on it more now is bringing up big red flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm almost 25 and it has become clear to me that I want to end my life.

When I was around 15, it became clear I wanted a university degree. I was an underachiever in school and my mother kept pushing me to drop out of school. She would scream and insult me when I resist. But I kept fighting back to stay in school, often involving counsellors to defend me because I felt I wouldn't be listened to if I spoke myself.

I didn't meet the requirements for university. My mother pushed me into a graphic design course I did for 6 months, then I pushed back into a university preparation course, then she pushed me into an arts degree after I completed the university preparation course, I did that for a year even though I didn't want to, then pushed back and started a Computer Science degree.

As you can see, there was no clear plan. Just two different conflicting ideals. But sadly for her, it is my life so she can fuck off and stop controlling it.

I did a year of a Computer Science degree. I consider going to university and doing a degree of my own choice the proudest thing I've ever been proud of -- because my mother made it her mission to make sure it doesn't happen. Yelling at me to give up and forget it.

The process of staying in school and going to university was a hurtful and intense experience which redefined what I want out of life, and my parent's roles in my life. It didn't happen once; it happened every year from 15 onwards until I no longer needed to rely on them. My sister believes my mother did nothing wrong and believes I'm just blaming her -- I believe she's just too blindly loyal to see any wrongdoing in my mother's behaviour.

After a year of my degree, I fell into deep depression and left university for 2 years. One year I was on the welfare, the next year I worked at a supermarket (grocery store). They didn't appreciate me there. I was honest about my struggles with mental health early on, and had issues with talking to myself in the isle. It was a tough experience.

After that, I quit and came back to university.

I have an ongoing backward-thinking habit. I don't know where it comes from, but it has existed for my whole adult life. I continually think about people, places, and memories from my past, and feel a frequent urge to search them up online to see how they are now. I feel regret at hurting others and smile at the nicer memories. I still think about YouTube personalities I used to watch at about 10 years ago who haven't uploaded videos for years.

I've seeked out EMDR because I believed it was trauma. But now I'm not sure. I don't know why I continually live in the past, but I believe it is a lifelong habit I'm stuck with.

Now I'm almost 25 in a week. I've seen many of my peers in the 4 different courses at 3 different institutions I've done graduate, I'm watching peers from high school and university have babies and get married. Every day I'm just reminded of how far away my high school years ago, and watch as peers keep moving ahead with their lives.

Even if I do graduate and get a degree, so what? I'm still going to keep looking backwards forever.

I've decided I don't want children because the inability to move on from past experiences isn't practical.

I've also had a lot of fun in my youth and it seems from here, it gets a whole lot more boring.

So I don't really see much point in being alive anymore.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey y'all,

Using an alt account bc I don't need anyone I actually know to see this. I kinda blew it with my last group of friends because I over shared how I was feeling and now I can tell they're much happier without me around and probably just don't want to think about my existence anymore, and I'm honestly totally in agreement with them. They didn't ask but I over shared anyway and therefore I'm a piece of shit who did this to themself. I've kinda just been drifting away from any and all social supports so losing this group of people I was halfway on my way to trusting is not quite the final straw, but we're getting pretty close. 

I tried to text my therapist but he never responded and I don't see him till Thursday. I don't think I'm gonna make it till Thursday, though. I don't think I'm even gonna make it till tomorrow. I was talking to my academic advisor, as I'm in college, and I have an appointment with her tomorrow too. Honestly I don't think I'm gonna live to see that meeting or her ever again. Maybe I should have said something a little more formal than ""see ya"" at the end of the meeting. She straight up asked me if I wanted to hurt myself and I kinda just dodged the question. She didn't ask me to elaborate or repeat her question.

The truth is, I'm frozen. Internally, I'm screaming and crying and begging for mercy, but on the outside it's business as usual. I don't think anyone I see in-person can actually tell that anything is wrong with me. Or they just don't care, which is probably closer to the truth. I've driven all my support people away. 

The only good thing left in my life is my cat and honestly, he doesn't deserve to have a barely-functional human as his caretaker. He deserves much better than me. Having him has been great for me but he isn't enough to get me out of the darkness I'm in. 

I keep trying to get across to people, without straight up saying it, that I think today is gonna be my last day. It feels like this is how my story is supposed to end. People won't have to constantly wonder if I'm safe or doing well. I won't be a burden any longer. It all just sounds very sweet, that I won't cause people stress they didn't ask for when they became friends with me.

&lt;p&gt;Using an alt account bc I don&amp;#39;t need anyone I actually know to see this. I kinda blew it with my last group of friends because I over shared how I was feeling and now I can tell they&amp;#39;re much happier without me around and probably just don&amp;#39;t want to think about my existence anymore, and I&amp;#39;m honestly totally in agreement with them. They didn&amp;#39;t ask but I over shared anyway and therefore I&amp;#39;m a piece of shit who did this to themself. I&amp;#39;ve kinda just been drifting away from any and all social supports so losing this group of people I was halfway on my way to trusting is not quite the final straw, but we&amp;#39;re getting pretty close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to text my therapist but he never responded and I don&amp;#39;t see him till Thursday. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m gonna make it till Thursday, though. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m even gonna make it till tomorrow. I was talking to my academic advisor, as I&amp;#39;m in college, and I have an appointment with her tomorrow too. Honestly I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m gonna live to see that meeting or her ever again. Maybe I should have said something a little more formal than &amp;quot;see ya&amp;quot; at the end of the meeting. She straight up asked me if I wanted to hurt myself and I kinda just dodged the question. She didn&amp;#39;t ask me to elaborate or repeat her question.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"
this is probably really messy and hard to read and it might have some typos .. i put my whole soul into writing this lmao that was rlly tiring and im too tired to reread this im just gonna go to sleep now. school tomorrow !!! cant wait !!!! the system is fucked

The only reason i haven’t killed myself yet is because i’m scared of failing. What if it doesn’t work and instead of dying i become braindead, deformed or crippled?

I don’t believe there can be anything worse after death than my life right now so i’m not scared of that. I’d much rather be in hell than here.

Sometimes i just sleep to avoid facing reality but i can’t do that right now because i have to go to school. 

I hate my parents because they forced me to live. If i was forced to live, then why can’t i choose to die? Life is much more worse than dying. I hate anyone who has children in this world. Can’t you see how fucked up this place is? Why would you want anyone to experience this, especially your own child? Like are you a sadist or something lmao

I’m just a burden and i know for a fact everyone hates me. I’m selfish. I’m so annoying that i make even myself angry. I’m repulsing to look at and i feel bad for anyone who has to see me every day. If i died, so many peoples lives would become much easier. I’m painfully socially awkward and i’ve been that ever since i was a child. Even my therapist stopped seeing me because she said i just can’t talk lmao. I don’t blame her. 

I don’t want to finish school and then work for the rest of my life to keep myself alive when i don’t want to be alive in the first place.

I can’t decide if i’m excited to die or terrified to die. My opinion changes constantly. In fact, when i started writing this, i was terrified. Terrified that there’s no other way out than dying. Terrified that i’m gonna experience death at some point, whether i want to or not. But now i’m excited. Excited to know that if something goes terribly wrong in my life i can always just kill myself. Excited that i have my life in my hands, excited that i can control at least one thing. Excited to see what’s after death and excited to feel the satisfacion of knowing that now finally everyone will believe how much pain i was in all these years.

There’s so many ways i could do it. I’m on sertraline and currently i have like 8000mg of it, not sure. I could take them all + some pills my mother and father have. I live near traintracks. If i felt like it, i could just get up now, walk for two minutes and i’d be there. I could cut my wrists or throat open. I could hang myself. I could jump off a cliff or a tall building. I could jump under a truck. I could drink or eat something poisonous. I could just break my neck or something idk there’s so many ways

I remember i had many friends &amp; was really popular in 1th-3rd grade but then something changed. I think people started caring about looks more than personality so nobody wanted to be seen with me anymore. After that i had 1 best friend. Everyone else either completely ignored me or bullied me. In 7th grade she started doing that too.

I don’t even want to think about the future. I hate it when people ask me what i’m planning on doing after school ends. Or where i see myself in 10 years. In a grave bitch!!! No but fr i don’t want to do ANYTHING i just want it all to end. Stop asking. I don’t want to think about it.

And i hate when i tell people i want to kill myself and they say ”but think about your family and friends. how will they feel?” GIRL WHAT FRIENDS !! my family will just be relieved that they won’t have to worry about me anymore. Maybe it’ll hurt them for a while, maybe a week, but in the long time run,, it woud make their lives much better.
Plus, i don’t want to be alive for other people, i want to be alive for myself. At this point i can’t even care if i hurt anyone. I’m in so much pain.

At this point, if someone tried to kidnap me, i would willingly go with them. Just to get a break from my life.

But now i think it might happen sooner.",t2_92pask99,False,,0,False,vent,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k42wof,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606792606.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;this is probably really messy and hard to read and it might have some typos .. i put my whole soul into writing this lmao that was rlly tiring and im too tired to reread this im just gonna go to sleep now. school tomorrow !!! cant wait !!!! the system is fucked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason i haven’t killed myself yet is because i’m scared of failing. What if it doesn’t work and instead of dying i become braindead, deformed or crippled?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe there can be anything worse after death than my life right now so i’m not scared of that. I’d much rather be in hell than here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes i just sleep to avoid facing reality but i can’t do that right now because i have to go to school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate my parents because they forced me to live. If i was forced to live, then why can’t i choose to die? Life is much more worse than dying. I hate anyone who has children in this world. Can’t you see how fucked up this place is? Why would you want anyone to experience this, especially your own child? Like are you a sadist or something lmao&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just a burden and i know for a fact everyone hates me. I’m selfish. I’m so annoying that i make even myself angry. I’m repulsing to look at and i feel bad for anyone who has to see me every day. If i died, so many peoples lives would become much easier. I’m painfully socially awkward and i’ve been that ever since i was a child. Even my therapist stopped seeing me because she said i just can’t talk lmao. I don’t blame her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to finish school and then work for the rest of my life to keep myself alive when i don’t want to be alive in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t decide if i’m excited to die or terrified to die. My opinion changes constantly. In fact, when i started writing this, i was terrified. Terrified that there’s no other way out than dying. Terrified that i’m gonna experience death at some point, whether i want to or not. But now i’m excited. Excited to know that if something goes terribly wrong in my life i can always just kill myself. Excited that i have my life in my hands, excited that i can control at least one thing. Excited to see what’s after death and excited to feel the satisfacion of knowing that now finally everyone will believe how much pain i was in all these years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so many ways i could do it. I’m on sertraline and currently i have like 8000mg of it, not sure. I could take them all + some pills my mother and father have. I live near traintracks. If i felt like it, i could just get up now, walk for two minutes and i’d be there. I could cut my wrists or throat open. I could hang myself. I could jump off a cliff or a tall building. I could jump under a truck. I could drink or eat something poisonous. I could just break my neck or something idk there’s so many ways&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember i had many friends &amp;amp; was really popular in 1th-3rd grade but then something changed. I think people started caring about looks more than personality so nobody wanted to be seen with me anymore. After that i had 1 best friend. Everyone else either completely ignored me or bullied me. In 7th grade she started doing that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t even want to think about the future. I hate it when people ask me what i’m planning on doing after school ends. Or where i see myself in 10 years. In a grave bitch!!! No but fr i don’t want to do ANYTHING i just want it all to end. Stop asking. I don’t want to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And i hate when i tell people i want to kill myself and they say ”but think about your family and friends. how will they feel?” GIRL WHAT FRIENDS !! my family will just be relieved that they won’t have to worry about me anymore. Maybe it’ll hurt them for a while, maybe a week, but in the long time run,, it woud make their lives much better.
Plus, i don’t want to be alive for other people, i want to be alive for myself. At this point i can’t even care if i hurt anyone. I’m in so much pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, if someone tried to kidnap me, i would willingly go with them. Just to get a break from my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel terrible because my life isn’t even hard compared to many other peoples lives. But it feels hard to me. I feel like if i killed myself it would just be natural selection. I’m too weak and sensitive for this world. At least im self aware ig&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to be old and i’ve known for years that i will kill myself when i turn 25. But now i think it might happen sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

She doesn't make enough money on her own to support us and I'm unable to contribute enough to matter (I'm on disability) I can't drive, and I can't do pretty much anything.

I just played my last game with my family and it was great but my sister mentioned that her birthday is in a few weeks and this is going to kill the mood a bit but it is what is

I’m so happy I’m going to die I’ve got my final meal planned (a gluten free wafer bar, a bag of salt and vinegar crisps and a can of Fanta ) I’m glad I get to try the bars I normally wouldn’t allow myself to eat them because I’m a fat fuck but that doesn’t matter because I’m going to die

I’m going to do it in 2 hours and 15 minutes and I can’t wait I’m going to take my medication wait for the tiredness that it gives me to kick in then hang myself and I know it’s going to hurt but it’ll be under a minute of extreme pain to take away all the other pain of life

I’m the happiest I’ve been in ages for the sole reason I’m going to die

I’m playing the last game I’ll ever play red dead redemption 2 story mode I’ve almost beat it again but it’s the third time playing it so if I don’t that’s fine I’ve also got 637godwin playing in the background (https://youtu.be/vKZ-22Z6duM this is the exact song if anyone wants it)

I just finished playing red dead and I finished the mission where you break John out of prison and I think that’s a good point to end playing I’ve still got about an hour left so I’ll just listen to some music until then

I’m playing with my cat for hopefully the last time and he’s so cute he’s rubbing his face against mine and I would like to be able to do this again but it’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make

,SuicideWatch,I was looking into school trying to maybe knock out a few classes but don't know really what I'm going for. Was just gonna try to knock out some general studies classes. Parents basically told me I'm too old (24) to not be pursuing a career already or I should get into some co-OP job programs or something to get my foot in the door somewhere. I don't know what I'm doing. They basically took all my excitement away from going back to school and just made me feel like a loser again. Laying in bed thinking about some way to end my life or sell all of my belongings to run off and enjoy my life for a bit before I kill myself. Idk where I'm going with this.

Then about 5 years ago everything just stopped going how they were meant to be. Nothing went wrong, its just things stopped going right. I think i became depressed but i have never been to a doctor about it I've only told my friends. i also happen to cut myself on the daily with the cuts getting progressively worse.

Everyday of my life i wake up and my first thought is something along the lines of ""Why this again?"" or ""just let me die already"". i also end the day with similar thoughts and of course the thoughts are with me throughout the day as well.

i am writing this whilst currently questioning whether or not its worth living until tomorrow and currently i am leaning on the edge of it not being worth it.

i tried typing out messages to my friends to reach out for help but i couldn't send them because i dont want them to worry and also i keep thinking ""what can they really do to help?"" and my answer to that is nothing much because why should they.

i haven't been to school in the past 2 weeks until today and instantly after being back at school for literally 2 hours i feel like I NEED to kill myself and its not just a want anymore. i think that my time is running out.

Just to reiterate. I dont actually think there is anything particularity bad about my life especially when you compare it to other peoples suffering. the worst thing is probably that i feel as though i cant talk to people who can actually get me the help i so clearly need.

I really need to be doing my work right now but I got home about an hour ago and ive just sat with my head on my desk so I'm not really sure why i wrote this but maybe this can help a bit.

&lt;p&gt;i haven&amp;#39;t been to school in the past 2 weeks until today and instantly after being back at school for literally 2 hours i feel like I NEED to kill myself and its not just a want anymore. i think that my time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to reiterate. I dont actually think there is anything particularity bad about my life especially when you compare it to other peoples suffering. the worst thing is probably that i feel as though i cant talk to people who can actually get me the help i so clearly need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need to be doing my work right now but I got home about an hour ago and ive just sat with my head on my desk so I&amp;#39;m not really sure why i wrote this but maybe this can help a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the rant&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"This is a rant. You can ignore it...

I live with an abusive/neglectful sister and neglectful parents with no way out. I can't move on my own yet. 

All my life I've wanted to still spend time with my family and ""friends"" and build a bond with them. They never wanted to do the same with me. Only with each other.

Recently I asked about it. I was met with hostility and told that I was basically harassing two of them about it all the time....It's been MONTHS since I even got to say ONE sentence to either of them. It's been years since someone actually cared about me, what I do, or how I am. 

What's worse, I was told to ""JUST GET A BOYFRIEND AND SOME FRIENDS!"" Yeah. Last time I tried that, it went TOTALLY well...NOT.

All the 'friends"" I ever had were all psychotic. Literally. They'd blame me for things that weren't my fault, assume I'm not good at anything, shame me for my looks, beliefs, etc, and treat me like trash. They were also huge hypocrites. What's worse is that they never want to hang out or talk with me unless they get something out of it. They think they don't have to be there for me EVER but if I can't be there ONE time for them because of something out of my control, I am bullied and harassed.

I feel like my life doesn't matter. My feelings don't matter. All I am here for is to be used and abused  because all I am is fat, disgusting trash with no intelligence or value. 

I don't want to d*e. But I don't want to be everyone I know in irl's target. There's no escape for me...and maybe I deserve to he used and abused. After all, I'm stupid, ugly and too weird to live, right? I was a mistake. Whatever put me here probably regrets it, too. I feel so worthless and unlovable...its not funny.

No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, I can never get help. I can never get out of my sh*tty situations, and I can never feel happiness. I'm done. I am the thing that is wrong with the world. 

So I decided to run away from this hell hole. I plan to live in the forest by the lake in my city, interacting with society as little as possible. All I do is disappoint. I think it's best for everyone if I hide away. 

No, I am not going to ""do it"". I still want to be here. I just need to hide, that's all.

Im 18, was gonna join collage next year. I hate myself for certain things I did which (maybe ) is the reason for my parents death. My parents are dead for years. They both suicided. My family(Grandmother, Uncle, Lil brother) they all love me, care me.. but I cant find reasons to live for them. 

After my parents died i always wanted someone whom i can love,  devote my life to, and that person would do the same for me!(like parents would do for there children. ) 

I found someone like that 2 years ago.. Loved her with all of my heart and souls.. but she left too a year ago.. reason was i couldn't give her any personal space.. i was always knocking her. Trying to make new convos.. getting sad with small things/actions of her.
Lesson i learned from my ex was, At this age no one will ever able to live happy for years with these phycological problems (getting obsessed, aren't able to give personal space) of mine.


After breakup, i tried to suicide. Tried phills tried to hung myself. None worked.. I found 2 things at that point: 1. hard truth that i cant painlessly kill myself and preserve my body at the same time. 2. Some good friends who tried to stop my suicide.(I was always an introvert. There was 2/3 friends in my life but I had to leave them because of my ex)

So after those failed attempts, i tried to get that thought out of my head and made ""friends"" as my reason to live.
But now after 10 months.. looking backwards, those friends dissapeared too 1 by 1.. And now im left with only few.. 

There's a friend who (unclear in my mind) i think i love, but she says, she will keep me as my best friend till death. I don't have problems in that but that psychological problem happens  again now.. I cant make myself believing at some times that she has her own things to do too.. whenever she's late.. or do her own work, i feel so much sad, ignored etc etc... Thats why for past 4 days ive disabled my social account to avoid contact with her fully (hoping that doing this will being a distance in my mind and i wont try to love her/get hurt)

at this rate.. ill never be happy with someone.. or find someone  whom i really can devote my life to. I kinda hate myself, im a introvert too. That's why i cant even change my attributes to make myself a better person... I cant even die cause there's no way to die painlessly (please dm if you know any) 

People says , "" wait, god have someone better for you in your future ahead...  ""
But after losing these many people for past 5 years, ive lost faith in my fate which god has decided.. I cant bring myself to think god has kept anyone for me in future for these things..(but i do have fear of burning at hell and believe of his and afterlife's existence)

I did everything in my life to try and make them happy and get their approval but it’s literally just impossible, it’s their life mission to make me hate myself and destroy every bit of self esteem I manage to scrape up. 

I’m the youngest, I did super well in school, graduated first in class with honors and many awards. I got myself a high paying job 2 months after graduation, all of it by myself without their support -they were against many things I did for myself professionally that lead me where I am today-.

They were never happy for me, if I was happy about something they’ll find a way to make it negative and destroy me. I don’t tell them about anything anymore, I spend so much time and effort talking and explaining things and they simply don’t care, which is fine, you can’t force someone to care.

I don’t have any social life because I have social anxiety and I don’t know how to talk to people. My mom raised me in a way to make me believe everything I say is wrong and shouldn’t be said. So, I’m always paranoid when I’m around people, idk what’s ok to say and what’s not. I always ALWAYS feel horrible after any social interaction and I just hate it all and I avoid it. Also, I know I can’t be close to anyone because I’ll never share my true feelings and thoughts with them because literally who gives a shit? And I’m too scared to do that anyway, so much PTSD from my mom making me feel like absolute trash for being myself.

Anyway, my ultimate dreams is to go to graduate school in the US or UK which my parents are against as well, but I’ll do what I can to achieve this dream anyway.

After that happens, I genuinely don’t have any other hopes and dreams or reason to live. I’m never getting married, never having kids, if there was a real God, he would’ve made having kids in this world a sin. I basically don’t have any human being I can be comfortable with, I’m not even comfortable with myself. Therefore, I’ve been contemplating suicide.

I hate my parents with all my heart for doing this to me. I have been physically beating myself a lot lately. I don’t just hate my family, I hate myself too for not being able to be happy on my own. I have no one and I wish I can be ok with that but it’s human nature and I simply can’t.

I don’t want anyone else to accept me other than the people who are responsible for my life but they won’t acknowledge anything I do or whether I’m happy or not. I cry out of pity and sadness for myself every single day and I physically beat myself all the time and they don’t know anything about it. They think everything is ok. I withdrew myself almost completely and they don’t care. I can’t talk to them like adults because they consider me a child and that I don’t know anything. They wouldn’t have an adult conversation with me. 

I really really just want this whole thing to end fast. I’m still waiting on my acceptances from grad schools and whether or not it happens, all I want to do in the end is for this life to be over fast. Please share any easy and quick suggestions to just die without leaving a lot of mess.

,SuicideWatch,"Typing this up, it makes me wonder how I even made it to age 15. A young woman, so genuinely abberant it's utterly disgusting. A degenerate like me should've never seen the light of day. I am an anomalous result in a science experiment, which unlike most studies performed by the greater minds is quite the opposite of formal- if there is a God, which I highly doubt, he must've swayed between amused and disgusted any time he acknowledged my existence. As egoistical as it sounds, I do think that He would've known about my presence on this earth- after all, I must be his favorite clown, and my life must be the most tragically comical pantomime.

I do not think I am a bad person. I am just a tired one. A 'gifted' child, burdened with scholarships, never ending IQ tests, and expectations; ones that I loathe like no other. With two parents, one a genuinely disgusting failure feeding off of his parents' bank account like a hound with insatiable hunger, and the other a mentally unstable model, who believes I am her personal secretary, financial aid, and cheerleader (by obligation and now personal will, of course). All this... it's tiring. Just exhausting, really. I have been living with both mental and neurological illnesses for most of my life (many people even assume my intellect stems from them- after all, no pain no gain, and all this 'depression' must be just growing pains, essentially). I speak 7 languages, but not in a single one can I express how much agony I truly feel watching the sun rise and set- a reminder that life goes on while I suffer is as disgusting as it is egoistical- I like to think I am the main character in my own story, but alas, it seems the tale of me has lost its only narrator in the splashes of ink upon the tattered pages. Not that anyone would care, though, as the narrator was an unreliable little thing anyway.

I think I have reached my limit. I don't want to describe the extent of my problems on here, as there'd be just too much to explore and explain, but all I can say it really is a lot. And 'a lot' doesn't even say much in the context that I'm drowning in.

I don't want to be alive anymore. 

Yes, there are still things in life that I enjoy, yet my entire life has been a giant emotional roller coaster. It's exhausting and I'm tired of the back and forth between ""normal"" and ""depressed"". The past few weeks, I noticed that I'm in the dark a lot. I couldn't bring myself to go to school, and therefore got beat up, physically and emotionally, by my dearest familia. They've ingrained the belief that I'm nothing into my head, and now as it plays on loop like a hellspawn gramophone, I realize I can't even take care of my basic needs like eating or keeping myself in an adequately clean state, let alone keeping my quarters tidy. It's an obstacle course. It's like I inhabit a dumpster site.

As I type this, I can't seem to figure on thing out, though- I don’t know whether it’s everyone around me that I want to kill or just myself. Having an undiagnosed antisocial personality disorder (which, oh trust me, I have- it's just illegal for me to obtain a proper diagnosis for it being a minor) really messes with me sometimes, and I can't figure whether I long for homicide or suicide to be the main even in my book of life.

In all honesty? I don't know why I'm typing all this. I think I'm beyond help. Antidepressants, shrinks, endless hospitalizations for being high risk... Not much more can be done- it's all gone to the point where I deem it hilarious.

I'd very much prefer to have never existed. I never fail to see life as nothing more than a rat-race set up to obtain the necessities for survival. In my eyes, suicide is a beautiful escape from the hopeless game we're all playing- it's a loss, yes, but one so brave I consider it a winning move.

I don't know how to convince myself that moving to aforementioned places is not the only fix for your life. I can theoratically move out of states for my masters(after writing  entrance exams which are extremely tough) but that's my only hope now and I'm not sure I'll succeed.

I have never dated because it is looked down upon. There is no dating culture here either unless you travel to other states in a good city to study which I couldn't due to my life situations and mental health which is caused by things which happened 2 years prior my college. 

I have never lived outside my home and never had anything like dorm experience

My higher secondary school (School after 10th grade) and my experience there made me depressed and affected my grades and personal life. 

There wasn't much personal life for me outside academia and family and because I kinda hate it here and there is not much life outside academia in asian countries. These last years, I have been socially isolating myself. My only hope was to travel abroad.

 I took a gap year after high school to prepare for medical entrance examination in an institution. That's the only time I have lived outside home and my peers were amazing and it's the only time I really felt connected but I had to quit after 3, months because of the system there which makes you constantly compare yourself and you have to study all the time(literally) except for one hour on every second Saturday where you can go out. Otherwise the warden will shout at you and force you to study.  It's where I first felt suicidal. 


I have never had any ""college experience"" and I ""chose"" a subject I didn't really like due to my mental health and I didn't had much choice and chose what is available. My thought was I could save money and not be a financial burden on my parents this way and I would be able to study masters abroad but now I'm a fresh graduate in bsc.botany and I realise now that my dream will not be fulfilled and far from reality because taking a loan to study a masters in biology aborad is a financial risk after researching about it. 

I have to continue schooling to get a job and probably a phd for my degree to worth something and even then job isn't guaranteed and if you perform well, you will get grants on a contract basis but the pay wasn't great. So it looks like I won't be able to settle even when I reach 30

Arranged marriage is the norm here and I'm terrified of the idea. To marry someone I don't know or not compatible with. I already feel like I don't belong here and this makes it worse. I just want to marry someone I appreciate and someone who appreciate me back for what we are. And this will only happen if I get a permanent job which I can't foresee. So I'll never be able to experience what it's like to be intimate with someone physically and mentally until my 30s or more or never. 

My only solution to fix all these was to move abroad but now I don't think it will happen due to financial barriers.

That&amp;#39;s the only time I have lived outside home and my peers were amazing and it&amp;#39;s the only time I really felt connected but I had to quit after 3, months because of the system there which makes you constantly compare yourself and you have to study all the time(literally) except for one hour on every second Saturday where you can go out. Otherwise the warden will shout at you and force you to study.  It&amp;#39;s where I first felt suicidal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never had any &amp;quot;college experience&amp;quot; and I &amp;quot;chose&amp;quot; a subject I didn&amp;#39;t really like due to my mental health and I didn&amp;#39;t had much choice and chose what is available. My thought was I could save money and not be a financial burden on my parents this way and I would be able to study masters abroad but now I&amp;#39;m a fresh graduate in bsc.botany and I realise now that my dream will not be fulfilled and far from reality because taking a loan to study a masters in biology aborad is a financial risk after researching about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to continue schooling to get a job and probably a phd for my degree to worth something and even then job isn&amp;#39;t guaranteed and if you perform well, you will get grants on a contract basis but the pay wasn&amp;#39;t great. So it looks like I won&amp;#39;t be able to settle even when I reach 30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arranged marriage is the norm here and I&amp;#39;m terrified of the idea. To marry someone I don&amp;#39;t know or not compatible with. I already feel like I don&amp;#39;t belong here and this makes it worse. I just want to marry someone I appreciate and someone who appreciate me back for what we are. And this will only happen if I get a permanent job which I can&amp;#39;t foresee. So I&amp;#39;ll never be able to experience what it&amp;#39;s like to be intimate with someone physically and mentally until my 30s or more or never. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only solution to fix all these was to move abroad but now I don&amp;#39;t think it will happen due to financial barriers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I lived in a developed or socially liberated country or area. I wish if my parents never sheltered me. I wish I was dead&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I want to start off by saying this: I feel like a total piece of shit for making this post. 90% of the posts in this sub are from individuals who are dealing with situations I couldn’t even imagine, and my troubles pale in comparison to theirs. Allow me to explain.

I come from a well-off midwestern family, I’ve gotten into a great university, and from an outside perspective, my life appears to be well on-track. I am fortunate enough to have everything I’ve ever needed provided for me.

That being said, I think I’m nearing the end of my rope. I don’t know what to do anymore, and I just want everything to end. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live like this either. I’ve thought about suicide almost daily, and at this point I’m just wishing I would die in some freak accident so that I don’t bear the responsibility for my own death. 

If you’ll indulge me, I’d like to explain how I got to this point. 

Since I was young, I’ve always been the child that my parents “never had to worry about”. I’m the youngest of four siblings, and a common stereotype in my family has always been that I was the “smart” one. The child that is going to “be just fine” all on their own. 

This stereotype was actually somewhat true during high school, for about three years. I was good at high school and my parents never had to ground me or take away privileges because of grades like they did with my other siblings. 

When the time came to apply to college, I got into an extremely prestigious university purely by nepotism. 

You see, I have an uncle who held a very prominent position at said university, and he pulled some strings to get me in. I know I don’t deserve it, but nevertheless I accepted the opportunity. 

Well when I got to the university, it was the first time I never had to answer to anybody. My parents always assumed I was the “smart” kid that was fine by themself, but things went south pretty fast.

I did okay (not well, just barely okay) during my first year, but it wasn’t long before things started to spiral. I began to struggle in class, and the stress of failing made it impossible for me to sleep. I would stay up all night (I swear to God this isn’t an exaggeration. I couldn’t sleep a wink) worrying about the work I needed to do for my classes. This became unbearable after a few months. I eventually turned to marijuana and alcohol just so I could get any form of sleep, and I turned to abusing adderall in order to get my work done. If my parents ever found out how often I abuse drugs, they would disown me. 

My plan of forcing my body to act how I wanted by using chemicals backfired in a really bad way. I NEEDED marijuana or alcohol In order to go to sleep, and I needed adderall in order to get ANY sort of work done. This system actually worked decently well, until I ran out of money. 

Today, I spend every. single. spare. cent. I can find on drugs. I’m either buying marijuana and/or alcohol to sleep, or adderall to get my work done. I’ve gone several days without eating food in order to save up money for these drugs.

But it wasn’t enough. I became very short on money, and I haven’t been able to regularly afford any of these “performance-enhancing” drugs as much as I used to. I’m on the verge of failing my third class of my college career, and I couldnt imagine my parents reaction if I told them honestly about my situation.

Truth be told, there is only one thing stopping me from putting a bullet in my head (I have a firearm, which only makes ending myself more tempting): it’s the story of one of my good friends.

About 9 months ago, one of my friends killed themselves. I went to their funeral, and the WORST thing I have ever witnessed in my life was his parents dealing with the shock of suddenly losing a son. I’ve never seen a human being suffer as much as his parents did. Thinking about it now makes me want to vomit. I saw his mother and father weep uncontrollably for hours. It fucked me up. 

The ironic thing is: if it wasn’t for my friend hanging himself, it probably would’ve been me. This fact only makes me more fucked up about his death. 

I broke up with my girlfriend of three years because I don’t want her to see me like this. I still love her so much, but It breaks my heart to think of her going through what I went through with my friend. 

I’ve called the suicide hotline several times tonight with no answer, so fuck it; here’s my throwaway account’s desperate plea for help. 

I don’t want to die, I just feel like I’m leaking pain constantly and there is nothing I can do to stop it.

,SuicideWatch,"Two years back (2018) my buddy (Not real names) Carl and I were at the skating rink with our friends and he was looking for a girl to meet. There was this girl skating around on her own out on the floor and he decided he would go and talk to her. Jump forward about a week they go out on a double date with Carl and I's friend, so the girl wouldn't feel as awkward cause Carl isn't the most talkative person. Because of this double date my friend posted the girl's snapchat on her story and I said screw it lets just add her. Well adding her turned out to lead to a solid week of both of us staying up until 7am texting or calling (once even just talking in a Fortnite lobby not even playing). One night she told me she broke up with Carl and she liked me and I said I liked her so we met at the movies and saw a horror movie. I met her mom that night after the movie and her mom liked me from the start. This little date led to many more and a relationship that lasted over a year. It was the happiest I had been but there was a huge thing that caused the break up.  


The breakup: My girlfriend was Rebecca, her best friend who moved to my school was Tess, and my best friend at school (who to for the longest time was into girls)\*yes it is important to mention this--was Quinn.  An underclassman who was in my choir named Abby as well.  
SO

Tess/Abby apart of the story

I became friends with Tess because she was dating my bestfriend, and then they broke up which led me and her to get a little closer ish cause she went to me asking about if she should break up with him etc. cause I was his bestfriend. So we became friends and it worked hand in hand cause she was rebecca's friend too! So yay right? Wrong. I didn't know that her friend Abby that she would walk around with at school, liked me. We became friends and then she told me she liked me and asked me out (knowing I had a girlfriend) and I said sorry no, I have a girlfriend and also she was too young for my interest. (she was a year younger and I personally only go older for relationships) She was sad and decided to start telling people I said yes instead, and that news got to Tess who loves drama.   


Quinn part

My bestfriend I became close with in Math class when we were seated next to each other and it was just our desks at the back of the room together, while everyone else had rows of 3+. So after her gf broke up with her, she sort of shut down and wasn't paying attention in classes anymore and her grades were slipping so in math I would take her sheets and do the work for her so she could just focus on getting better. The point we started really talking was one day the back of her hand had a bandage on it and I asked if she was okay and she said yes but the next day it was off but she had new marks on her other hand so I knew something was up. I asked her to stay after class in the room (THE TEACHER WAS THERE STILL but is chill and knew it was a sorta like important private conversation) so I talked with Quinn and she told me about it all and that she had depression and fought with suicidal thoughts and harming herself with fire or cuts. We talked and we hugged it out cause I know it's not easy being depressed cause I had issues with it myself for years. That sparked the friendship then we just would hangout in school when we had classes and didn't know other people and crap. this went on for a long time until one day I saw she had a new bandage on her hand, and I asked her what was up but she just walked away leaving me confused. I texted her that night asking if she was okay and she said yeah it was nothing. I decided to ask if I needed to tell someone this time (an adult) and she said no its okay. She started wearing long-sleeved shirts that week and it was winter so I didn't think it was other than being cold.....Well...We go up to my locker in a study hall one day and she follows me but I didnt ask her. She shows me her arms were really hurt and said it was because I didn't give her the affection and feelings back to her (I didn't pick up on anything cause I am just a moron) and she said she would keep doing them cause she couldn't have me as her boyfriend...So on a shitty day for me, my friends, and just everyone I was close with I decided to make one person happy even just a little bit and to try as a way to get her not to hurt herself over me. I kissed her right then and there...This is when I was already a year into dating Rebecca (who btw went to a different school). Quinn started telling her  friend who was also Tess's other friend that we kissed and Drama Queen Tess started telling people I was dating an underclassman, that my bestfriend moved her seat in all our classes to sit next to me (INCLUDING CHOIR????? but they were sopranos and I was bass across the room?) and then talked to me and saw that I had cut my forearm length wise and deep with a  pen that morning. She said she understood and wouldn't tell Rebecca but I would have to and I agreed to.   


When I was on my way home I decided I would tell her on our call that night. But an ""anonymous"" account on Instagram DMd Rebecca about it all....and we all know who that was...and I was in the car with my mom who just found out her brother tried to kill himself. (I just realized there is a lot of depression and suicidal behavior in people around me...but welcome to my school. You think someone is a happy person they are not..) So I denied that the account said I was having stuff with 3 people...cause the drama just started that it also was my friend Erin ( who i was in a fight with anyways during all this and we were not speaking) I said no thats not true because erin and I were in a fight. So I told the truth there but not the full truth. And she said okay etc. I didn't know how to then tell Rebecca about Quinn. So I didn't.... But i slowly distanced myself from Quinn but she tried to be more clingy. I gave the cold shoulder and then we sort of drifted and it hurt to lose my bestfriend like that. Jump another week I am in an auditorium about to perform with choir and I get a text from Rebecca saying that Tess had texts from a person who said we were dating (abby) and she was pissed. So I was like ""Oh fuck"" cause I had to perform in five minutes. I told her I can text after we perform she said okay. SO after the performance I text abby and bluntly ask (this is word for word) ""are we dating"" and she replies ""No you said you wanted to just be friends"" I reply ""Okay thank you, why did you tell people we were"" and Abby replied with ""Because I wanted it to be true""...I took a screenshot of this and send it to Rebecca and Tess with proof of Abby saying herself we were not dating and I declined the offer. No one cared. I was to them, lying about it. I skipped school the next three days. Got super depressed and didn't even leave my room for meals. I had a few bottles of water and some gold fish in my room. yeah.   


Rebecca and I argued for a while and we went on break so she could figure it out. Then the next week in school I get a text saying we need to talk immediately. I couldn't at the time and told her when I could, at like 11:30. In my tech class I asked the teacher if I could take an important call in the hall (we are at a far end of the building by a parking lot door so not a main hall) Rebecca calls and tells me that we are done. That I was lying about it all and said don't talk to her for a while. I lost it. I texted my friends in the class asking if they could bring out tissues and I sat there in the hall my head between my knees crying my eyes out for half an hour. Tess's ex that was my friend was one of the two guys that are my buds that sat there and I told it all to. Worst moment of it all to this point was her saying ""Im breaking up with you."" it was over a year of dating gone...After this we didn't talk for a few weeks, but Tess video called me, In her car outside of her new boyfriends house (She dated this guy before my buddy and now after) and she was sitting in her car crying saying he knew he made it all up about me and Abby and that she was the anonymous account on Instagram. And added more to the rumor about Quinn and I. She cried her eyes out saying sorry and the reason was because she loved me and if I wasn't with Rebecca she would have asked me out and try to hook up with me (meaning sex yes). I was so pissed off I punched my wall till my hands bled from every knuckle.  


After not having talked with Rebecca her and I started talking and just every time it was about the breakup and I wanted to get back together and told her about Tess in the car. But it never mattered. We had these back and forth fights for 6 months. She made a friend during this and she said they were just friends until the last day. On the last day we were not fighting and I was saying I was thinking about joining the military, and she said cool, and then said that the friend was now her boyfriend. I was so hurt by that part and I lost my cool. We got into a big fight where Rebecca proceeded to say things like ""I don't care about what you do with your life"" ""Go and join the military for all I care. I dont give a fuck."" and then the one that hurt pry the most was ""You think you were special? Everything we did I have done before. Even stuff in the bedroom!"" and emphasized the point of I wasn't anything special to her....She gave her boyfriend my number and he told me to fuck off or he would come beat the shit out of me or something...I only replied with ""It's alright. You won't have to""...he didn't respond to that, and she was still flipping out on me and I said ""You don't have to worry about me anymore.."" I threw my phone and opened my desk drawer where I have random stuff, for making sculptures!!! not originally for any other use.  


There was a piece of broke glass in there and it was sharp to the point of light drag of the tip would cut you...So I did. Alot. I started from my fingertips and let it all just drip onto the floor (there are still the bloodstains on my floor to this day...7 months later) then I slowly worked up my hand more. I knew at this point I coulnd't just leave my best buddies without saying goodbye. So I sent each of them a message (while still losing blood) saying like they were my best bud and like personalized stories of us growing up together like we did the past 6 years. And I said that this was goodbye at the end. Quentin called me then and there while the other two made a groupchat of us all and were looking for my address in our messages on discord (we had talked about my houses after I had moved the past year so I showed them where I was at now) Q called me and was literally crying. I only knew him once before to have cried. He said something Ive always thought but never wanted to be weird and say but He said him self we are like brothers. That just made me so fucking sad cause I wanted to leave. They had said something to one other person to get them to tell their parents and get them to text my mom and dad. I was getting texts from so many people who I didn't even know I existed at school. I always felt so invisible. One of the people called the cops. My mom called my dad and woke him up at 1am and he was pissed he was woken up before he saw me in my room, crying, on the phone with Q and dripping blood down my hand still. I told Q i had to go as my dad came in and sat down. My sister came down saying she got a text from my friends younger sister who we grew up with...This was beyond my friends and school at this point, it was to old friends from other schools I havent talked to in years at this point, and then the cops showed up. They said they did have to mark it down as an attempt but they didn't need to take me away cause my family was there and everything etc. My family sat at the dinning room table and I cried. I just cried. Then my doorbell rang...The three best buds, all of which absolutely hate driving....and all lived different amounts of over an hour away. Chuck woke up his mom said ""we need to go."" and he drove and got Q and Bren. They showed up for their first visit to my dad's house at 3am to be there and check on me. They knew I was more likely to talk to them over my parents anyways. I can't tell you how much that hurt and also was comforting. Hurt cause I tried to leave this and was willing to hurt these three amazing fucking people. And comfort cause ya know they were there. That night I had to make a promise that I wouldn't text Rebecca ever again or try to talk to her. Then the next day I also had to do situation control and repair to anyone who messaged me. I didn't go to school for a week and when I came back not much changed. Teachers that were chill knew something happened but not exactly, so they were fine with me putting my head down and just shutting out the world. I was very clear I wasn't going to do work in classes, and I slept. I ended up telling only three teachers who asked if I was okay, I basically said ""Im getting better, but just so you know- it got to this, suicide attempt, bad"" They were understanding and gave hugs. I liked it but hated it. I hated the stares from people in the halls and I hated the whispering in the halls. I put in my earbuds and just drowned out the noise. Its been 7 months now and I am happy I didn't finish doing what I wanted that night. But it all still is present in my mind and I never got to fully vent it like this. But don't make someone your one source of happiness. Don't try to make everyone happy. Don't put yourself out there for everyone. Worry about yourself and immediate situational help people but thats it....I sorta became jaded and cold to people since then and now I only talk with Q Chuck Bren and a few other people who are online friends. I have met someone else and she is amazing but she doesn't know all what happened back then she only knows I had an attempt.

Jump another week I am in an auditorium about to perform with choir and I get a text from Rebecca saying that Tess had texts from a person who said we were dating (abby) and she was pissed. So I was like &amp;quot;Oh fuck&amp;quot; cause I had to perform in five minutes. I told her I can text after we perform she said okay. SO after the performance I text abby and bluntly ask (this is word for word) &amp;quot;are we dating&amp;quot; and she replies &amp;quot;No you said you wanted to just be friends&amp;quot; I reply &amp;quot;Okay thank you, why did you tell people we were&amp;quot; and Abby replied with &amp;quot;Because I wanted it to be true&amp;quot;...I took a screenshot of this and send it to Rebecca and Tess with proof of Abby saying herself we were not dating and I declined the offer. No one cared. I was to them, lying about it. I skipped school the next three days. Got super depressed and didn&amp;#39;t even leave my room for meals. I had a few bottles of water and some gold fish in my room. yeah.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca and I argued for a while and we went on break so she could figure it out. Then the next week in school I get a text saying we need to talk immediately. I couldn&amp;#39;t at the time and told her when I could, at like 11:30. In my tech class I asked the teacher if I could take an important call in the hall (we are at a far end of the building by a parking lot door so not a main hall) Rebecca calls and tells me that we are done. That I was lying about it all and said don&amp;#39;t talk to her for a while. I lost it. I texted my friends in the class asking if they could bring out tissues and I sat there in the hall my head between my knees crying my eyes out for half an hour. Tess&amp;#39;s ex that was my friend was one of the two guys that are my buds that sat there and I told it all to. Worst moment of it all to this point was her saying &amp;quot;Im breaking up with you.&amp;quot; it was over a year of dating gone...After this we didn&amp;#39;t talk for a few weeks, but Tess video called me, In her car outside of her new boyfriends house (She dated this guy before my buddy and now after) and she was sitting in her car crying saying he knew he made it all up about me and Abby and that she was the anonymous account on Instagram. And added more to the rumor about Quinn and I. She cried her eyes out saying sorry and the reason was because she loved me and if I wasn&amp;#39;t with Rebecca she would have asked me out and try to hook up with me (meaning sex yes). I was so pissed off I punched my wall till my hands bled from every knuckle.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After not having talked with Rebecca her and I started talking and just every time it was about the breakup and I wanted to get back together and told her about Tess in the car. But it never mattered. We had these back and forth fights for 6 months. She made a friend during this and she said they were just friends until the last day. On the last day we were not fighting and I was saying I was thinking about joining the military, and she said cool, and then said that the friend was now her boyfriend. I was so hurt by that part and I lost my cool. We got into a big fight where Rebecca proceeded to say things like &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care about what you do with your life&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Go and join the military for all I care. I dont give a fuck.&amp;quot; and then the one that hurt pry the most was &amp;quot;You think you were special? Everything we did I have done before. Even stuff in the bedroom!&amp;quot; and emphasized the point of I wasn&amp;#39;t anything special to her....She gave her boyfriend my number and he told me to fuck off or he would come beat the shit out of me or something...I only replied with &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s alright. You won&amp;#39;t have to&amp;quot;...he didn&amp;#39;t respond to that, and she was still flipping out on me and I said &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t have to worry about me anymore..&amp;quot; I threw my phone and opened my desk drawer where I have random stuff, for making sculptures!!! not originally for any other use.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a piece of broke glass in there and it was sharp to the point of light drag of the tip would cut you...So I did. Alot. I started from my fingertips and let it all just drip onto the floor (there are still the bloodstains on my floor to this day...7 months later) then I slowly worked up my hand more. I knew at this point I coulnd&amp;#39;t just leave my best buddies without saying goodbye. So I sent each of them a message (while still losing blood) saying like they were my best bud and like personalized stories of us growing up together like we did the past 6 years. And I said that this was goodbye at the end. Quentin called me then and there while the other two made a groupchat of us all and were looking for my address in our messages on discord (we had talked about my houses after I had moved the past year so I showed them where I was at now) Q called me and was literally crying. I only knew him once before to have cried. He said something Ive always thought but never wanted to be weird and say but He said him self we are like brothers. That just made me so fucking sad cause I wanted to leave. They had said something to one other person to get them to tell their parents and get them to text my mom and dad. I was getting texts from so many people who I didn&amp;#39;t even know I existed at school. I always felt so invisible. One of the people called the cops. My mom called my dad and woke him up at 1am and he was pissed he was woken up before he saw me in my room, crying, on the phone with Q and dripping blood down my hand still. I told Q i had to go as my dad came in and sat down. My sister came down saying she got a text from my friends younger sister who we grew up with...This was beyond my friends and school at this point, it was to old friends from other schools I havent talked to in years at this point, and then the cops showed up. They said they did have to mark it down as an attempt but they didn&amp;#39;t need to take me away cause my family was there and everything etc. My family sat at the dinning room table and I cried. I just cried. Then my doorbell rang...The three best buds, all of which absolutely hate driving....and all lived different amounts of over an hour away. Chuck woke up his mom said &amp;quot;we need to go.&amp;quot; and he drove and got Q and Bren. They showed up for their first visit to my dad&amp;#39;s house at 3am to be there and check on me. They knew I was more likely to talk to them over my parents anyways. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how much that hurt and also was comforting. Hurt cause I tried to leave this and was willing to hurt these three amazing fucking people. And comfort cause ya know they were there. That night I had to make a promise that I wouldn&amp;#39;t text Rebecca ever again or try to talk to her. Then the next day I also had to do situation control and repair to anyone who messaged me. I didn&amp;#39;t go to school for a week and when I came back not much changed. Teachers that were chill knew something happened but not exactly, so they were fine with me putting my head down and just shutting out the world. I was very clear I wasn&amp;#39;t going to do work in classes, and I slept. I ended up telling only three teachers who asked if I was okay, I basically said &amp;quot;Im getting better, but just so you know- it got to this, suicide attempt, bad&amp;quot; They were understanding and gave hugs. I liked it but hated it. I hated the stares from people in the halls and I hated the whispering in the halls. I put in my earbuds and just drowned out the noise. Its been 7 months now and I am happy I didn&amp;#39;t finish doing what I wanted that night. But it all still is present in my mind and I never got to fully vent it like this. But don&amp;#39;t make someone your one source of happiness. Don&amp;#39;t try to make everyone happy. Don&amp;#39;t put yourself out there for everyone. Worry about yourself and immediate situational help people but thats it....I sorta became jaded and cold to people since then and now I only talk with Q Chuck Bren and a few other people who are online friends. I have met someone else and she is amazing but she doesn&amp;#39;t know all what happened back then she only knows I had an attempt. I don&amp;#39;t need sympathy from people here or anything I just need to get this off my chest in full.&lt;/p&gt;

So yeah. If I tried and survived I'd probably just get yelled at more.

Fuck this. Fuck all of this. I hate this world. I can't even remember a time I was last happy.
I was born chronically ill. My entire childhood was hospitals and suffering. Then I got older and had no friends. Got bullied to my first suicide attempt at 8 years old.
When I told my parents I need help I got yelled at. Then puberty hit and I got dysphoric. My parents called me a disgrace to the family for being trans. I still only have one friend who doesn't accept me as trans either. I am still fucking ill and suffering. My grades are shit because I got too depressed to study. I probably won't even pass highschool, I'm a senior. I have no future, no real family support exept money, nothing.
When I try reaching out to people I get yelled at, I trust nobody. Every night I have panic attacks.
Every night I want to die. 
I can't even leave. I have to stay with my parents because their insurance pays my meds without which I would die. They threatened to force me to do a local apprenticeship of their choosing if I don't get accepted into a university by January, which I won't. 

Nothing makes me smile. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing brings me relieve. I hate school. I hate life. I hate my body. I hate everything.

i dont know how to start this but i'm a 24 year old queer (bi) muslim woman whos ugly af and will never not hate themselves. my parents abused me a lot when i was younger, they stopped physically abusing me around high school and have been genuinely trying to build a relationship with me. I think they feel guilty for the things they did so i want to try working on forgiving them but things they did to me as a child are still so heavily ingrained in me. 

religion has been used as a tool to make me feel guilty about my existence. I dont mind being muslim, i like the general idea of it. I believe it has many faults but I think thats due to culture that surrounds it. But the guilt i feel from having sex or smoking weed, or being in love with someone whos not muslim consumes me. I feel like i will never stop feeling this guilt unless i get married to a muslim man. I'm falling in love with a white guy (its literally been only three months... fucking ridiculous i know) but in my culture, I should be getting married soon. My parents are never gonna accept a white non muslim man.  And for some reason I'm convinced if i marry a non muslim man i will go to hell. I tell myself its ridiculous and i shouldnt let that control my life but it does and i cant get rid of it at all but it's always just this ""what if all the things i was taught is true and its a sin to be queer and feel love for non muslim people and I spend the rest of eternity in hell""

Chances are, the person i'm with will break up with me. he doesnt love me, he probably never will. I think i'm just temporary for him. Someone to be here for him until he moves and starts his life somewhere else. and you know what, thats ok. as long as i'm useful at least. I'm trying so fucking hard to not be a toxic piece of shit who needs reassurance every moment of my like. They're gonna move to the other side of the country whenever they can. that could be in a few months to a few years. I have no fucking idea. He suggested the idea of possibly moving there too but i think he wasn't serious about it. 

if he was, i want to but that would mean distancing myself from my family because they wouldnt accept that. the only way they would is if he converted and we got married. No one would do that for me. and i would feel like shit asking for them to do it but there no other way for an ok ending to my life. 

I think im destined to be alone. I have a fucked up sense of reality due to the sexual abuse i faced from my uncle and the phsyical and mental abuse i faced from my parents. I'm too fucked up for anyone to actually love. 

its literally just not possible so whats the fucking use. the only solution there is is for me to die. might not do it today but once things start falling in place and no one wants me around anymore, its just bound to happen. or i can just set that in motion and do it right now.

Yesterday, my brother tried to commit suicide by jumping off of a bridge. He just moved to California last week, and when his roommate called me they were completely shocked that he had done this.

I am tired of being all alone. All of my friends have all had multiple relationships by now, but I haven't even had a single person be interested in me and I am certain no one ever will be. I think relationships are a unique type of love because that person had no affiliation with you, but at some point decided that you were worth it. I just want to be in one relationship just to prove to myself that I worth someone's love, but I know that I am not and I will never feel that validation.

The problem is that I absolutely hate talking to people, but equally hate being all alone. If I could actually talk to people then maybe, but there is no way I could talk to random people. I even hate to talk to my friends for some reason, which results in me pretty much missing out on what is supposed to be the best years of my life.

I can't even imagine being in a relationship because it makes me feel bad. Every time I have a crush on someone, I realize that I would be wasting their time if they actually did like me back. I am so objectively inferior to them that it isn't even funny. They could do so much better than me and I know that the only way someone could ever be interested in me would be if they settled. If they settled for me, it would make me sad because I actually care about them and I know I would be wasting their life if they settled for me when they could do better.

I understand that there is more to life than relationships, but its hard when you are a failure in every aspect. I originally wanted to become an electrical engineer, but after taking calculus and ap chem I have realized that I am just objectively not smart enough to do it. Everyone else gets it but I just sit in the back of the class just doing nothing. My friends try to explain it to me but I just can't do it. So now that I know the only thing I even slightly wanted to do is impossible, I don't know what to do.

There isn't really anything I want to do with my life. I am afraid of growing up and going to college just to continue being all alone. I just want some kind of purpose, but I know that I won't find it. I think people find purpose in relationships or dreams, and I don't have either. There are so many problems with me, some that can't be fixed, that I will never be get to be happy. I think that some people just were not made to exist, and that I am one of those people because I have no talents.

To top it all off, I had a really pathetic dream where a girl just held my arm lmao. It made me really happy because I've never experienced it. This story made me realize how useless my existence is if I get excited because a girl in my dreams held my arm. Like damn, that is just pathetic.

I think that some people just were not made to exist, and that I am one of those people because I have no talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, I had a really pathetic dream where a girl just held my arm lmao. It made me really happy because I&amp;#39;ve never experienced it. This story made me realize how useless my existence is if I get excited because a girl in my dreams held my arm. Like damn, that is just pathetic. I don&amp;#39;t want to exist anymore if this is all there is to it and I am ready to die.&lt;/p&gt;

Throughout my (relatively short) life I’ve lost 3 good friends to suicide, a sister to cancer and a girlfriend to another bloke, and for the most part I blamed myself for not being a good enough friend to help them, not being with my sister at the end and not being good enough to keep my girlfriend with me. Needless to say, this sent me into a pretty shit place for a while, prior to today I had 1 attempt at my own life through sculling a bottle of Ritalin, fortunately it didn’t do shit but make my head fucked for a week. Since then I’ve had professional help, went to a clinic for 2 weeks and was (what I considered) recovered for a good year or 2. However, I had quite a miserable couple of weeks where I feel nothing but a nagging “you’re wasting life” feeling. To cut out what happened particularly today in which caused this I’m just going to jump to me driving back home.
I was driving, was more upset than I’ve been in a while and figured “life ain’t gonna change” made sure no one was around, gassed it to him play a game of chicken with a tree, only thing that stopped me was the fact ik meeting my best friends girlfriend in 2 days and didn’t want to ruin that for him. Long story short I spun out and was in a small ditch on the side of the road luckily without dents (parents would have killed me). I’m feeling better right now but I’m not going to be driving for a little bit (my own choice) but yeah, the rest of the trip was me screaming at myself about how stupid that was and all that shit.

,SuicideWatch,"My life really sucks right now. For as long as 5 years I’ve been miserable. Things just seem like they never worked out for me for that entire time. I feel as if I’ve wasted an important part of my life. I am currently 20 years old. I just finished my finals and I’m pretty sure I failed two classes. This past semester did not go well at all. My depression was at its peak. I’ve been feeling really strange lately. I have a dark, lost, hopeless and regretful feeling 24/7, if that makes sense. This depression made me not want to do anything at all this past semester. I didn’t listen to any of my lectures for the second half of the semester. I hardly did any of my assignments. Because of this, I will probably be losing my scholarship which is the reason why I even get to attend a university. To top all this off, I don’t have friends. My social skills are terrible, I have extreme anxiety, and I more than likely have a bad future headed my way. I hate myself so much right now. These feelings are ruining my life! I wish could go back to a certain point in my life and fix my flaws.

I know what made my life so miserable. I know the exact decisions that turned fate against me. A little back story.

During my eighth grade year and freshman year of high school, there were a lot of people who wanted to talk to me, get to know me, hang out with me, etc. Being the center of attention was amazing. It gave me a lot of confidence, more confidence I’ve ever had in my entire life. But unfortunately that came with arrogance and it was that arrogance that made me seem weird and unlikeable to people. That is what jump started my insecurity. From then on people have never wanted to get to know me. I’ve tried so hard to try and make friends. Whenever I try to talk to people, the response is always the same, people look at me like I’m a weirdo and resort to the better option which is pretty much anyone else besides me. Even if I do seem to come close to making friends it just ends tanking in the long run. So many social opportunities missed, because I wasn’t more humble and should’ve been more practical. Because I have no friends at the moment my social skills suck!  

                I also used to run in middle and high school. I had the potential to be a good runner, but the arrogance that was present in my life during my freshman year lead me to not train and work hard at what arguably makes up the majority of my happiness. Not reaching my full potential in the sport caused me to feel trash. With running I could’ve gone to a better university. Now that I don’t have running anymore, it hurts so much to think I never reached my full potential. Life would be way more enjoyable knowing I tried my best and made major accomplishments in the sport of running.

                The last thing I totally screwed up is my relationship with my family. I love my parents, I appreciate everything they’ve ever done for me. Without them I wouldn’t be here. Unfortunately I’m not close with them at all. Every time I’m with them, it is awkward. This is mostly due to me feeling like a total failure every day. This feeling makes me take out my depression on my family. I know that my relationship with my family would be better if I didn’t have my depression.

I dont even know if the hospital would take me, considering covid restrictions. Last time I was hospitalized was March. No visiting hour. Gymnasium shut down. It was dirty. Nurses didnt care. Nothing to do. 

I'm 23. College dropout. Cant hold a job for more than a couple months. Cant get hired. Cant take care of myself. Depending on handouts from mommy and daddy. Turned into such a crazy asshole after my ex dumped me I finally got diagnosed. Screaming at my friends in the street. Breaking down sobbing. Sending a thousand messages to the ex that alternated between name calling and guilt tripping. I'm an asshole. Toxic. 

Whats the fucking point. 

Bipolar and borderline. What a combo. Just like my cousin. Shes getting an ugly divorce. 3 kids. Whoop de do, put in the work, take the meds, and get my wedding dress stolen and burned at 40 because I treated my spouse so poorly.

Every word that comes out of my mouth feels like manipulation. A lie. Guilting people into telling me I'm not a piece of shit, because I'm sad about it or whatever. Why the fuck does no one ever get mad at me. Why do they let me.. Why. Why man? ""Let me."" Jesus.

Don’t wanna die. Just wanna be in pain. Have not had hallucinations, have not felt EXTREME nausea, literally just a little. How the hell am I not feeling anything if people who overdose on 300 mg or 600 mg literally end up in the ICU? I took 1500 fucking mg.

,SuicideWatch,"I was extremely suicidal at one point.  And I found something extremely dreadful out. It starts with depression, but like anything other life threatening disease the longer you fight something, without it being cure, the more tired you get.  But that’s not exactly what I want to talk about.  

Is anyone aware of certain conditions, where you cannot choose things your bodies does.like for example some people can’t sleep, even with medication involved.  There’s also a illness where for some reason, you get irresistibly strong urges to sleep, and no matter how hard you fight it, you end up sleeping.  I’m sure even without that sickness, you know how hard it can be to fight sleepiness.

Well imagine this.  Imagine having a irresistibly strong urge, to kill yourself, and for some reason you can’t stop it.    It sounds bad, but to further prove that this is literally the case for some people, let me say this.  
Many people who end up killing themeselve weren’t born sad.  In fact I would argue no one in this fucking world was literally born as a baby suicidal from day 1.  Okay, so what am I getting at here?? I’m trying to show that,  people don’t even want to kill themselves most the time, there’s a reason there’s so many posts about people begging for help, or for advice.  And for the people who actually do want to kill themselve, most don’t act on it, because of the pain.  But by those words, there would be no suicides right!!

FUCKING WRONG!!!
I simply stated those things, to shown how literally the urge to kill oneself, can be so fucking strong, we literally cannot fight the urge.  

Tbh I was raised Catholic, and for a while I actually ducking hated that mother fucking bitch lame ass excuse for what we call a loving God.  How could the biggest religion of this loving God, say people who commit suicide go to hell.  Most of these mother Rucker’s who preach that shit, have probably never fucking been Suicidal.  These people are also the same ones who say, theirs a reason for suffering, it’s to make us stronger.  Fuck you people who say that shit.  You really think suffering, with things getting so bad to the point we literally cannot stop ourselves from killing ourselve, is to make us be a better person.  How TF DO YOU FIGURE THAT, when u think we are in Hell.   That religion shit is so lame.
But if I’m being honest, it’s also what got me fucking out of barely controlling my suicide thoughts.  
One day, this I swear was the fucking weirdest shit ive ever experienced.  When things were about to get fucking messy, I heard a voice loud as fucking day day, please don’t do this.
At first I was confused as hell.  Literally, I thought maybe my parents had come by my house.  But no literally I was the only one in my house.  No windows were open, so it wasn’t some neighbors.

I swear I don’t think I’m a good example of a Christian at all, but for some reason he saved me.  I still don’t fucking no why.  But I do know this.  Please they might not be able to control their urges to kill themselve, but we can put them in positions were they have no access to things that will do the job.

Quick tidbits:

It's honestly been a long-time coming, given I've ruminated on doing this for a while (I think I started when I was about 14; I'm 17 now). I can't stand people in generality -- yes, friends and family are too a part of that abstract.

I have AD/HD-I -- which was just recently diagnosed -- and I have to do a few stupid fucking blood tests to get the medication I need for attention sustainment, but I'm honestly not motivated to get them.

I realistically could commit myself to improving my life significantly -- as I am ostensibly at the bottom of the pit right now -- but the effort requires more life, and since I am currently unable to exist in a manner that I view as feasible, enduring life for my betterment is not desirable.

My (clinically diagnosed) OCD has worsened which has resultantly negatively impacted my mental health, generally speaking. I've actually gestated two new, somewhat-symbiotic-to-my-unwillingness-to-read compulsions: re-reading shit to ad-infinitum despite having comprehended whatever it is I'm reading the first time and dissecting sentences.

I'm an idiot; I always have been one.

I have many ideas that I will never share due to my fear of failure.

,SuicideWatch,"LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD

Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.

Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?

The Full Story (long)

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

The Backstory:

In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to boys on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. 

Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with boys on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. 

When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. 

My Realisation:

In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. 

This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. 

Advice Needed:

This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But I cannot move this, it feels like something that is going to haunt me forever. I want to be better and grow from this - but how can I? It feels like something I shouldn’t be allowed to move on from. 

I’m also going to get help from a therapist of some kind because this has really affected how I view myself and I have been suicidal over this (please don’t be sympathetic - I know the focus should be on my victims). I would appreciate any former catfishers giving me advice on how to discuss this issue with a therapist, as well as how to process this guilt and shame.

Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:

I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. 

To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you.",t2_8yhmtnvn,False,,0,False,I can’t live with my guilt from catfishing,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k3p45m,False,dark,1.0,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606740787.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD&lt;/p&gt;

The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Realisation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice Needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But I cannot move this, it feels like something that is going to haunt me forever. I want to be better and grow from this - but how can I? It feels like something I shouldn’t be allowed to move on from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also going to get help from a therapist of some kind because this has really affected how I view myself and I have been suicidal over this (please don’t be sympathetic - I know the focus should be on my victims). I would appreciate any former catfishers giving me advice on how to discuss this issue with a therapist, as well as how to process this guilt and shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you.&lt;/p&gt;

20 years old.  No skill.  No relationships.  No passions.  

I have to decide my major in a couple days and it’s sad how uncertain I am with what I want to do with the rest of my life.  If I don’t even seem to care now, then what’s gonna happen when I start studying and trying to get a job?

So my daughter was born on 05.   She is 14 yrs old.   Last time I saw her was right before she turned 1 and her mom took her off to Pennsylvania to live there.   Her mom dumbed me because I joined the marines corp instead of use my scholarship to play basketball in michigan. (Not the actual michigan university).  So I graduated basic training and after my 3rd day home I broke my hip and femer in a car wreck.   (Got a medical discharge after that).  I was bound to a wheelchair for 9 months (was supposed to be 12). 

Child support started right when I got into the wheelchair and racked up almost 8 grand before I was even able to make a payment.    (I'm almost caught up at this point in time).  

So I deal with depression and suicidal thoughts daily.   I have always wanted to be apart of my daughter's life.   On top of it all she might be the only kid I ever have due to fertility issues.   My depression ruined my 10 yr marriage because I got sucked into doing drugs to numb the pain.   Started drinking heavy as well.   I'm clean now and have a awesome and understanding girlfriend but she doesn't know how to handle me when Im in my dark place.   I distance myself from everyone and everything that I like to do to keep my mind off it.   I shut down emotionally and just wanted to step out in front of a semi.   

I feel like I'd be better off without this life.   I try my hardest to keep my family and girlfriend in mind to stop me from doing anything that would hurt them.   I can't afford theraphy because of child support and basic living expenses.   So trying to do any type of theraphy is out of the question.

,SuicideWatch,"Please don’t take this as self pity but as self-awareness. I genuinely genuinely hate my life. I grew up without a father with a younger sister (by  a year) and a mother who had the mentality of a teenager and always chose men over her children. I was raised by my grandparents most of my life. My grandfather died last year, it was rough. My mother (much better now!!) was neglectful and extremely verbally and physically
Abusive. One time my sister cried because her toothbrush fell on our filthy floor and my mother threatened to beat her over it and then did. My sister was four at the time. 

I grew up in Two very Raggy and dilapidated apartments caused by our filth. My mom cleaned nothing and was lazy, we never cleaned either. We got bed bugs when I was in highschool. I’ll never forget opening my back pack in history and seeing one in there. Scars you for life. I don’t want to blame my mom fully because we knew that we were messy; (we as I. My sister and I), but it’s the fact that we were never taught how. I was AND STILL AM so ashamed of the living conditions (they are better now). It’s so embarrassing. The air was plagued with second hand smoke and not an ounce of love. I grew up poor as well. My clothes never fit. I was made fun of for wreaking of cigarrette smoke all of my school time and for clothes that never fit.

I was never paid attention too (not saying this caused this btw) but I think it led to my ADHD being undiagnosed. I have super bad ADHD. It affects everything, I cannot focus or think straight, I’m impulsive, indecisive and irritable. I was made fun of this as well for my hyper ness. I was never told I was loved or that same one was proud of me.. explains my low self esteem.

I’m the black sheep, no one acknowledges me and that’s ok, it’s my fault. I’m stuck in this pessimistic mindset due to depression and Borderline Personality Disorder. It’s a lot to explain and get into but if you have it; I’m so fucking sorry, it’s the worst. My emotions are EXTREME. When you’re  happy, Im ecstatic, when You’re  sad, I’m despondent. It feels like the world is always ending, my heart always feels like it’s sinking, my chest is burning. I long for attention for the existence to never fade, but once it does I’m in utter rage, I’m uncontrollable; uncontrollable mood swings, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, anger, impulsiveness, irritability, suidical thoughts, fear of abondonnement... this HURTS MY MIND. THIS HURTS MY
BODY. THIS HURTS MY SOUL.


My family shuns next when I go to them because I have pushed them so far away when I was a teenager. I took all my anger out on my grandmother. I want to die I regret this so much. I hurt her so bad and Just can’t live with it. She’s so affected by it and I don’t mean to sound selfish but so Am I. There is something WRONG with me. I could not control this anger I literally could not ground myself. I feel so guilty, I wish I could give my lofe for my grandfathers I don’t deserve to be here. I dont. I feel as if the impact I leave in everyone is negative. I feel as if I can’t overcome these hardships and that they do define me. Soem days I feel so numb I can’t see, my brain feels floating. Soemtiems I wish it were that way. 

I have no one to talk to and don’t have insurance to actually get the lrofessional help I need.

For context: Today I had an...more or less enlightning argument with my parents.  
I'm 18F and grew up in a broken home, mostly in the center my mentally unstable mother. 

Since I was little she would abuse me emotionally and since I was around 13yo she added physical abuse as well, which created -of course -extreme resentment in me. With her growing insanity (aka having more delusional rants &amp; going more and more of the rails with abuse), I started to reject pretty much every she said. Even when it was logical or useful.

This created sadly a huge disadvantage.

Most notable, the fact that, since I started college I began to neglect my chores &amp; started behaving in irrational patterns. Aka, I would wander around at night, overslept on weekends (meaning I didn't eat with family, which is a rule) and generally neglect keeping my space clean. Things that weighed down a lot on my parents, especially named mother who is currently over-stressed from her work as a secretary in an overrun hospital.

Well, we had an argument about it today. And even though I hated it, I finally saw that I was behaving like a dick. And I felt pretty ashamed that I basically neglected to behave like a good person, just because I would simply resent my mother and push everything on the fact that she was/is abusive.

And...Idk...I think this sent me down a rabbit hole.

One of my biggest fears was always to not be a good person, but pretending to be one.

Y'know. Growing up under a sociopath, in an life were people would constantly take advantage of you (objectivley here), in an area that was everything but nice...I started to develope a lot of unhealthy, ""insane"" traits along the line:

I admitted this in another sub, but f.ex. I can be very manipulating. No, I don't lie chronically. Mostly because I don't have a reason to, but if I am forced I can basically ruin the lifes of people. I already did ruin the lifes of 3 people, partially.

I'm very violent. Passed down from my mother, I would live out my violence during the ages of 10-13yo. Doesn't sound heavy, because ""aww, kids brawling"", but it really was very bloody and I especially very ruthless. I'd break bones, knock out teeths...I think at one point I waterboarded one even. The thrill of the fight and the potential to establish dominance was wonderful! Sadly, even though I know today that it's ""wrong"", I just...can't shake it. When I'm angry at a person, I have the strong urge to beat them up to a pulp. I fantasise killing them. Sometimes even plan their deaths. I miss the thrill of beating people up, hearing them beg &amp; cry. Especially boys. 

I have a very long line of mental problems that I don't even disclose to my therapist.

For example, I have extreme shitty skin. Mixed with bullying &amp; constant pointing out from others without any change, I developed a form of...Buffalo Bill complex, I guess. When I see a girl with beautiful skin, I sometimes want to rip her face off. Bash it in and see how she cries about it. I want to cut off my own face sometimes as well. Like, a clean cut off and then just put a new face on top of it. I don't have this obsession a lot, but in the forst case I have to put on a mask I own, because I panic so much I literally can't stand feeling my face.

The fact that I'm a maladaptive dreamer and have a detailed dream world where I'm the goddess of a horror world who runs a crooked version of HR/limbo, that I see sometimes monster in shadows, that I have sometimes weird obsessions with serial killers, that whenever somebody gives me something to drink in their home I suspect that it's poisoned even though I know this person for fucking +10years...

...combine this with my ""real"" loser life, aka no job, studying something I don't want and partially don't understand, regressing social skills &amp; social contacts...

...I just wonder if I'm maybe too much of a goner to keep living. I mean, we hear it in media everywhere!

The moment you're a ""degenerate"" it would be better if you'd die. If you're a pedophile you should die, because you're a threat to childen. If you're transphobic/homophobic you should die, because you're a threat to trans/homosexual people. If you're a sociopath, or psychopath you should jump off a cliff.

And...Idk. I sometimes wonder if there's truth to that.

I mostly influenced other people's lifes negativley. And I still do, as seen from the beginning. I know I'm fucked up, but I often don't notice how I fucked up.

,SuicideWatch,"THIS TEXT IS OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE IT WAS WRITTEN RANDOMLY OVER A COURSE OF SEVERAL MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE EVENT AND I DIDNT TRY TO MAKE IT CHRONOLOGICAL. Why am I the one that has to try. Why am I the one that has to make an effort. Why can't other people. No one talks to me unless I reach out first and that isn't fair. Is it just an energy I give out that makes people just avoid me. Did I do this to myself in a way. Now granted I could try but again why is up to me. Is it because they don't feel alone so they don't have to reach out. Or that they have each other even if they did feel alone. What about me makes them all choose not to reach out to me. She reached out and invited me over multiple times before she moved. Why can't the rest of them. If she was still here would she still do that. I had fun that summer. I had friends that did stuff with me. The pool party was the first of it's kind. I literally never did anything like before. Most of us hung out a lot that summer into the fall and winter of that year. Just going over there and watching something stupid on netflix and making jokes about it. Just hanging out is all I want. The last time that happened was months ago and even that was with one of them and his other group of friends. The movie was fine but I didn't really enjoy myself for whatever reasons. I didn't know them. They weren't my friends. I was the odd one out like I always am. They were his friends. He only invited me because we talked earlier that same day and i said anyone could invite me anywhere at anytime and i would instantly agree because even at that point i was tired of being alone. They enjoyed the movie as a group. I enjoyed it alone. I sat with them and I watched the same thing as them but I was not with them. After the movie we went to the bathroom and he showed off what I thought were cuts to his friend. I would later find out that they were burns. They were a very close group of friends and I did not belong. They walked to a store together in the cold at like midnight. It didn't make me feel good, missing out on the trip. It was strange. I didn't care to go to the store but I still felt like I was missing out. And I was. I was missing out on human contact which i so desperately wanted. Just the fact that all of them had households that didn't care where they were or what they did, and I have been stuck with overprotective parents my whole life. Until mom, when I just stopped caring altogether. Or they texted them and the parents let them do what they want. All the while dad was on the way to pick me up. Pisses me off that he cares so much. He is so overprotective. Or he would be if I did anything anymore. Both parents were growing up. I guess you can't fault them for that. I just wanted to have fun with his friends. To be fair I didn't ask dad but I doubt he would have let me just walk to a store in the dead of night with a group I barely knew and he didnt know at all. She had stopped talking to me for months  at that point. Before her it was really bad. I begged him to let me play with them for so long and they finally agreed. I went over once and they collectively decided I wasn't allowed to play with them. He told me to leave the group chat. I brought it up in the group chat instead. I wanted to know how everyone else felt about me in the game. No one stood up for me so clearly no one wanted me there so I left. A month later I guess I reached out in a way and I got a response. She did some kind of post on her story about how people were feeling that day. I said I was the lowest, only for attention, obviously, and she reached out. I guess that is why it stuck. Or the fact that my friends had recently kicked me from them in a way. Her post and response happened on a day where I went to the doctors to do some tests to try to figure out my headaches at the time so I had something to say when she asked what was wrong. It was a small conversation, if you can even call it that. Most of them were. She started two conversations out of the months we were texting. 2. I should have stopped before she did. Clearly it meant nothing to her and I wish I could say the same but I can't. My friends ditched me and she was the first person to reach out after that. For as long as it did last I enjoyed talking to her. I started all conversations after that first one. All except for one. There is nothing special to say about that one. She had just seen endgame and I'm pretty sure I talked to her before she texted so it doesn't count as her texting me first. I actually looked forward to texting her and would overthink what to say. I liked her. I don't think I had a crush on her but I also wouldn't be surprised if I did. Just the fact that she reached out was enough to make me fall at the time. Didn't talk irl because I don't do that. I was nervous. I had nothing to say and nowhere to say it. Because why would she talk to me. I was thinking about, even for a little bit, if she even knew who she was texting. If she did, why me. Just because I did something for attention one time. Why did she keep texting me after that. Was she just that nice of a person or did she like me. If she did like me how could she just stop like that. And again did she even know who she was talking to. Even now I mean I'd be surprised if she didn't. But it was never confirmed if she did. We never got deep with our conversations. I wanted to but I guess I didn't. Maybe it would have been weird but I just wanted to get to know her. Genuinely. Just how she was and what she did in school that day. But it meant alot to me which is stupid because again we never got close. How close can you get just behind a screen. One time she said that we should go to kd with a group of people sometime or something. That didn't happen. We stopped texting before summer. I think I texted too much at some point or she just got bored but eventually she stopped responding. I got defensive trying to figure out what went wrong and she didn't give me an answer. I tried like a week later and she finally said she was just busy. That may have been true but doesn't make sense. We didn't text but a couple minutes total the days I texted her. That is why I think it was just an excuse. I think she got bored and just stopped. I get very defensive and read too much into stuff. She very well could have just been too busy to text me I guess.Been alone since. Until he invited me to the movies but I already explained that. I live in a house with strangers. I think it is just my thing to be alone. I like being alone because I dont like people and because they hurt me, but it also hurts to be alone. It hurts so much that I am numb i guess. I dont know if this is how i actually feel or if i am just writing this to sound worse than it is. I truly dont know how i feel about anything. I hate that I am doing this but I might as well try to explain everything. I don't think I have actual reasons to feel this way. I am just sick of it. I'm not even an adult but I know it doesn't get better. If anything it gets worse. I haven't had to do anything so far in life. Dad blames himself. I was the baby of the family so both parents babied me for too long. They were going to start chores right as we were getting ready to leave MO. Then it was Mooses. Then the first apartment and mom. Dad just never got to it. Dad still does today, but he is trying to change that now. Of course me being me I dont want to do anything. I was a pretty active kid. I'd wake up too early to go outside and spend the day with my friends. Now I spend all day everyday in bed. I want to change but I don't at the same time. I used to be happy. I truly dont think I have been happy since MO. I was somewhat bullied in MO but it really wasn't that bad. I was just a bitch. I still am. I complain about things that aren't even remotely close to problems other people have. Id get picked on outside or on the bus and run to mom. I got pushed once by my friends and ran and cried to her. All i have ever wanted is to be popular. I think everyone deep down wants that. The popular kids in school get all the special attention while even back then i still didnt have many friends. They dont have problems talking to people. Good for them for that. Ive always had that problem. Then we moved after a school year where I tried to fit into a specific group of people. Lived for six months at Mooses. 7th grade was the best and worst time of my life. The first half of the school year was amazing. It was the first time girls showed interest in me. I had a female friend that I was at least somewhat comfortable around. It was my first time with female friends. I was still nervous around her but less so than the other one. I had a problem with eating in school my entire school career so I would always bring candy to lunch (starting after mom died) but I wouldn't eat it. Even now I just give away my candy and dont even bother going to the cafeteria. Now that I had a female friend I just gave it to her. Some kid said i only did it because i liked her, which was true i did as a friend but i was too stupid to say that so instead my face got red and i said i didnt.  The other girl was more of a crush. Now I had had crushes before 7th grade but never had they showed interest back at me. Anytime she would talk to me my face would turn red. She even called me out on that one time. I dont remember what I said in response. She touched my shirt to get my attention and I was so happy, I guess, that I asked mom not to wash it. I know that sounds stupid because it is. I really liked the attention i got from both of them. Like i said it was my first time with female friends so i treated it differently. I shouldn't have. I had to move in the middle of the school year and the one I had a crush on somehow heard about it before I told her and said that I had betrayed her. Even back in MO I still rarely started conversations so I definitely didnt walk up to my crush and tell her I was moving for multiple reasons. I still wasn't comfortable talking to her in general let alone starting a conversation. Looking back I should have been better and done better. The entire situation is so stupid now. Then I had to move and switch schools in the middle of the year. I was not looking forward to that. I almost instantly made friends. They are the same group I have now. The same group that hurt me without knowing. Then mom died. It was very sudden. I didn't know what to do or how to feel. It hurt alot. I was only 13. Dad signed me up for therapy shortly after because he thought I needed it and I probably did and still do. I hated therapy because it was boring and I didn't think I needed it. I hate myself. I absolutely hate everything about myself. Dad sometimes asks me what I care about and I dont answer. How can I when I dont think I care about anything. I can't be honest and hurt him. But I guess nothing matters anymore. And that is not a healthy state of mind i know this but i can't change it. I haven't been happy in months if not years. Not truly happy anyway. I spend all day every day watching stuff on my phone. This let's me forget how I feel until I stop watching. I used to play games too but now that is boring. Honestly so is watching the same things I have already seen multiple times before but I have nothing else. I dont want to do anything anymore. I have no one. Not really. That is just how I feel now. My friends dont talk to me. Not for a long time. Maybe they aren't the friends that have conversations. Or they just dont talk to me but they still talk to each other. I haven't been this alone before. I dont like it. I could reach out to anyone but I know they wouldn't really care about what I have to say. Neither do I honestly. I'm just so sick of feeling like this. I truly dont see an end to this. I dont know how I am feeling. I have no idea how to explain this. I'm just done. Thinking about the past hurts. All the things I didnt do. Missed opportunities that have led me here. I dont think I'm in pain. I'm alone. I dont know if I have done this to myself or if other people did this to me but I feel so alone. I am so alone it hurts daily. I often cry thinking about it. I'm positive I want to die. I've just seen enough of life to know I dont want to be alive anymore. I'm just sick of everything. Nothing makes me happy anymore or even brings me the slightest enjoyment. It's been like this for a while. I guess when I started feeling like this I already knew it was over. I can't imagine living feeling like this for much longer. I'm just tired. Nothing can help and I dont know if I would even want help. This is my choice and I dont need help making it. Just to hang out is all I want. Even before the virus, I still didnt get out much. I was never invited. Literally never. If I were to be invited, both back then and now, I would agree because I'm tired of feeling this way. I could invite people but no one would want to because it's me. At least this is how I feel and how I felt before the virus. I knew I could invite people places and dad even said I should on multiple occasions but I thought why would they want to. Why would they agree to go somewhere with me. I didnt and still dont think i am good enough for friends i guess. It sucks. All I want is friends and I guess I could have them but why would they choose me. This group has already hurt me and literally hasn't reached out since. That was close to 2 years ago now. I was so alone at one point I asked dad to go to a store just to see all the board games I could play if I had people to play with. I'm sorry but dad isn't enough. That sucks to say. I know this but it is true. I drifted from everyone after mom, but dad was the worse. He used to offer to do shit and sometimes I would agree but most of the time I didn't. That in and of itself is another reason I did this. The fact that I would literally rather be alone and in pain than with him. I am such a piece of shit and I apologize. Back to the board game story, I just looked at the shelves of games I literally would have spent my money on if there was a guarantee my friends would play with me. Maybe they would have but I never tried for fear of rejection from my own friends. That rejection came anyway. Why would anyone take me up on an offer. I just cant comprehend that. I would take anyone up on anything because I am so alone. But why would anyone take me up on an offer. What do I have to offer people. In my mind the answer still is nothing. I hate myself so much. Absolutely everything about myself. I'm done. Still doing this. It's as if I want to be sad. Or I'm just used to it. I'm so messed up that I wish I had more problems so I could end it. I feel like my life isn't bad enough to end it. I dont know if I even want to die or if I just want attention. I dont think I have any reason to kill myself. I dont know anymore. I know it is selfish,  but I don't care. I don't care what you will think of this when I go through with it. I'm sorry but I need to do this. I'm tired of feeling this way. And honestly I dont even know what I'm feeling anymore, but I know it isnt good. I need it to stop. I dont think I have any reasons to stay alive and I know that is a fucked up thing to think, but it's true. I just dont want to be alive anymore. I hate living so much, it hurts on a daily basis. I'm genuinely sick of everything about life in general.

Why am I the one that has to try. Why am I the one that has to make an effort. Why can&amp;#39;t other people. No one talks to me unless I reach out first and that isn&amp;#39;t fair. Is it just an energy I give out that makes people just avoid me. Did I do this to myself in a way. Now granted I could try but again why is up to me. Is it because they don&amp;#39;t feel alone so they don&amp;#39;t have to reach out. Or that they have each other even if they did feel alone. What about me makes them all choose not to reach out to me. She reached out and invited me over multiple times before she moved. Why can&amp;#39;t the rest of them. If she was still here would she still do that. I had fun that summer. I had friends that did stuff with me. The pool party was the first of it&amp;#39;s kind. I literally never did anything like before. Most of us hung out a lot that summer into the fall and winter of that year. Just going over there and watching something stupid on netflix and making jokes about it. Just hanging out is all I want. The last time that happened was months ago and even that was with one of them and his other group of friends. The movie was fine but I didn&amp;#39;t really enjoy myself for whatever reasons. I didn&amp;#39;t know them. They weren&amp;#39;t my friends. I was the odd one out like I always am. They were his friends. He only invited me because we talked earlier that same day and i said anyone could invite me anywhere at anytime and i would instantly agree because even at that point i was tired of being alone. They enjoyed the movie as a group. I enjoyed it alone. I sat with them and I watched the same thing as them but I was not with them. After the movie we went to the bathroom and he showed off what I thought were cuts to his friend. I would later find out that they were burns. They were a very close group of friends and I did not belong. They walked to a store together in the cold at like midnight. It didn&amp;#39;t make me feel good, missing out on the trip. It was strange. I didn&amp;#39;t care to go to the store but I still felt like I was missing out. And I was. I was missing out on human contact which i so desperately wanted. Just the fact that all of them had households that didn&amp;#39;t care where they were or what they did, and I have been stuck with overprotective parents my whole life. Until mom, when I just stopped caring altogether. Or they texted them and the parents let them do what they want. All the while dad was on the way to pick me up. Pisses me off that he cares so much. He is so overprotective. Or he would be if I did anything anymore. Both parents were growing up. I guess you can&amp;#39;t fault them for that. I just wanted to have fun with his friends. To be fair I didn&amp;#39;t ask dad but I doubt he would have let me just walk to a store in the dead of night with a group I barely knew and he didnt know at all. She had stopped talking to me for months  at that point. Before her it was really bad. I begged him to let me play with them for so long and they finally agreed. I went over once and they collectively decided I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to play with them. He told me to leave the group chat. I brought it up in the group chat instead. I wanted to know how everyone else felt about me in the game. No one stood up for me so clearly no one wanted me there so I left. A month later I guess I reached out in a way and I got a response. She did some kind of post on her story about how people were feeling that day. I said I was the lowest, only for attention, obviously, and she reached out. I guess that is why it stuck. Or the fact that my friends had recently kicked me from them in a way. Her post and response happened on a day where I went to the doctors to do some tests to try to figure out my headaches at the time so I had something to say when she asked what was wrong. It was a small conversation, if you can even call it that. Most of them were. She started two conversations out of the months we were texting. 2. I should have stopped before she did. Clearly it meant nothing to her and I wish I could say the same but I can&amp;#39;t. My friends ditched me and she was the first person to reach out after that. For as long as it did last I enjoyed talking to her. I started all conversations after that first one. All except for one. There is nothing special to say about that one. She had just seen endgame and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I talked to her before she texted so it doesn&amp;#39;t count as her texting me first. I actually looked forward to texting her and would overthink what to say. I liked her. I don&amp;#39;t think I had a crush on her but I also wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if I did. Just the fact that she reached out was enough to make me fall at the time. Didn&amp;#39;t talk irl because I don&amp;#39;t do that. I was nervous. I had nothing to say and nowhere to say it. Because why would she talk to me. I was thinking about, even for a little bit, if she even knew who she was texting. If she did, why me. Just because I did something for attention one time. Why did she keep texting me after that. Was she just that nice of a person or did she like me. If she did like me how could she just stop like that. And again did she even know who she was talking to. Even now I mean I&amp;#39;d be surprised if she didn&amp;#39;t. But it was never confirmed if she did. We never got deep with our conversations. I wanted to but I guess I didn&amp;#39;t. Maybe it would have been weird but I just wanted to get to know her. Genuinely. Just how she was and what she did in school that day. But it meant alot to me which is stupid because again we never got close. How close can you get just behind a screen. One time she said that we should go to kd with a group of people sometime or something. That didn&amp;#39;t happen. We stopped texting before summer. I think I texted too much at some point or she just got bored but eventually she stopped responding. I got defensive trying to figure out what went wrong and she didn&amp;#39;t give me an answer. I tried like a week later and she finally said she was just busy. That may have been true but doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. We didn&amp;#39;t text but a couple minutes total the days I texted her. That is why I think it was just an excuse. I think she got bored and just stopped. I get very defensive and read too much into stuff. She very well could have just been too busy to text me I guess.Been alone since. Until he invited me to the movies but I already explained that. I live in a house with strangers. I think it is just my thing to be alone. I like being alone because I dont like people and because they hurt me, but it also hurts to be alone. It hurts so much that I am numb i guess. I dont know if this is how i actually feel or if i am just writing this to sound worse than it is. I truly dont know how i feel about anything. I hate that I am doing this but I might as well try to explain everything. I don&amp;#39;t think I have actual reasons to feel this way. I am just sick of it. I&amp;#39;m not even an adult but I know it doesn&amp;#39;t get better. If anything it gets worse. I haven&amp;#39;t had to do anything so far in life. Dad blames himself. I was the baby of the family so both parents babied me for too long. They were going to start chores right as we were getting ready to leave MO. Then it was Mooses. Then the first apartment and mom. Dad just never got to it. Dad still does today, but he is trying to change that now. Of course me being me I dont want to do anything. I was a pretty active kid. I&amp;#39;d wake up too early to go outside and spend the day with my friends. Now I spend all day everyday in bed. I want to change but I don&amp;#39;t at the same time. I used to be happy. I truly dont think I have been happy since MO. I was somewhat bullied in MO but it really wasn&amp;#39;t that bad. I was just a bitch. I still am. I complain about things that aren&amp;#39;t even remotely close to problems other people have. Id get picked on outside or on the bus and run to mom. I got pushed once by my friends and ran and cried to her. All i have ever wanted is to be popular. I think everyone deep down wants that. The popular kids in school get all the special attention while even back then i still didnt have many friends. They dont have problems talking to people. Good for them for that. Ive always had that problem. Then we moved after a school year where I tried to fit into a specific group of people. Lived for six months at Mooses. 7th grade was the best and worst time of my life. The first half of the school year was amazing. It was the first time girls showed interest in me. I had a female friend that I was at least somewhat comfortable around. It was my first time with female friends. I was still nervous around her but less so than the other one. I had a problem with eating in school my entire school career so I would always bring candy to lunch (starting after mom died) but I wouldn&amp;#39;t eat it. Even now I just give away my candy and dont even bother going to the cafeteria. Now that I had a female friend I just gave it to her. Some kid said i only did it because i liked her, which was true i did as a friend but i was too stupid to say that so instead my face got red and i said i didnt.  The other girl was more of a crush. Now I had had crushes before 7th grade but never had they showed interest back at me. Anytime she would talk to me my face would turn red. She even called me out on that one time. I dont remember what I said in response. She touched my shirt to get my attention and I was so happy, I guess, that I asked mom not to wash it. I know that sounds stupid because it is.

,SuicideWatch,"So before I start I just want to say that yes I am suicidal. I want to end it. I want to leave. I have always thought about it. My life sucks and Ive always felt really sad and empty inside. I dont know if im depressed because my family doesn’t believe in that and they don’t take things like that seriously so i’ve never gotten diagnosed. I just feel empty. I often fantasize leaving the earth or something worse when Im at work or alone at home and its really hard not thinking about anything else. I avoid talking to my family because most of them are assholes. My mom is incredibly narcissistic, my stepfather is selfish money hungry bastard and my brother is abusive. The only reason i stay alive is because of my younger brother, who looks up to me and who I adore.

I dont know if im depressed because my family doesn’t believe in that and they don’t take things like that seriously so i’ve never gotten diagnosed. I just feel empty. I often fantasize leaving the earth or something worse when Im at work or alone at home and its really hard not thinking about anything else. I avoid talking to my family because most of them are assholes. My mom is incredibly narcissistic, my stepfather is selfish money hungry bastard and my brother is abusive. The only reason i stay alive is because of my younger brother, who looks up to me and who I adore.

I had the Act scores, the grades, etc to get into an ivy in high school- even with all the mental illness I managed to make it through. But it didn’t get into any of them, and the school I did get to and wanted to go to my mother suddenly withdrew my deposit from because she wanted to redo the floors instead. 
I haven’t learned anything. I haven’t found any of the work engaging. Everything is so fucking awful. I rot in my room all day will slowly I start developing more and more neurosis. I can’t focus for more than a second. The body dysmorphia makes me not want to open my computer because I could see my face in it. I can’t read any more the letters all come off the page I’m speaking this out right now because it’s hard to type. My parents are assholes as usual. And god the anxiety and the depression- everything and nothing at once, tou know the gist, it’s under it all. I’m almost at the same level I was when I first tried to kill myself 4 years ago, before my current anti depressants. I’m taking my meds. But I’m still this fucked up. 
So I’m failing. I can’t transfer. I hate my body more and more and the only girl who ever thought I was hot was an abusive cheater. I don’t see any opportunities. The world is falling apart and I can’t even finish one goddamn hw assignment. How the fuck do I explain this to my professors or my parents? I just want to walk into traffic or **** ** ******
should I hospitalize myself? I want to die so bad but it would hurt the person I care about more than anything and I can’t do that to her. A what do I do?&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hello there, I’m 17M and as you probably know I want to kill myself. I’ve wanted this for a couple of years now and was going to shoot myself but I didn’t do it as I didn’t want the mess, since then I’ve been thinking of “clean” methods and even created some poisons and bought gasses, all I’m missing is a diving mask or something.

As for why I want to do it... well first Of all I’ve been going to a therapist for a 2 years and before that I was going to get checked for adhd which didn’t happen because my father stopped it. Parents separated now so I got it through but it’s my last year of school, was supposed to be anyway. Now my doctor is feeling me it’s more likely to be either depression or anxiety and it’s taking so damn long to finish, then they sent me to school nurse which is saying it’s way more likely to be adhd. It doesn’t matter what it is I just want the solution, which I’m not getting when I need it. And now on top of that I’m in even more checking because I have stomach problems which might be that I’m celiac or have an irritable stomach (I don’t know what it’s called in English sorry)

I really don’t want to do another year of school, but even if I finish it I don’t see a future for myself. I don’t see a way out which will be more than hell. I don’t want to lay in bed thinking of everything, so I drink, which my mother doesn’t like as well I’m 17 and chugging bottles of whatever I can find. I would probably already be deep in drugs if I had a better access to it.

I think the worst thing is that despite all of je bad things I don’t know how and I don’t even think I want to know how to fix it, I just want an excuse to kill myself.

I’m not telling my therapist this as he doesn’t understand, I’ve only told my mother previously through some long nights that end with her not sleeping a night before work.

Lastly I want to end with that I have been to school about 50% of the time now, gone mostly because of diarrhea or upset stomach, I don’t eat and it hurts and when I do eat it also hurts so most often I opt for not eating. And the rest of the time I’m away I fake the stomach aches so I can just sleep or do something to get my mind of things without actually doing anything. Even when at school all I can think about is how I can’t do anything, how even if I do something I’m copying others which is a whole other problem with all my attachment issues and how I’ve felt so lonely and abandoned by those I’ve loved

I’m sorry this is long, I’ve actually written a couple of these before but never pressed post as I don’t want this to be because of attention but today, well today I’m feeling extra bad and I really need a reason to not go shoot myself, I don’t want the mess for someone to clean u

I’m fat, I’m ugly, and I’ll never live up to their expectations. This is why I come here, I just wanted somewhere I could just let this out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I wanna make it clear that my parents are great people and great parents. Their one weakness is stabilizing their kids’ mental health&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Let's start off with my story. Two years ago, I was properly diagnosed with depression. However, this depression was left untreated until now. No therapy. No medication. I remember that day very vividly when my doctor talked to my mother about how I was feeling. My doctor highly suggested that I was put on medication immediately and put into therapy. My mother called me the greatest actor (or really actress) in the world. She sort of yelled at me in the car, asking what she's done wrong or how come she didn't know. I cried on the way home that day. Please do not get my wrong. I believe both my parents are fine parents. They just grew up in a different culture, especially since they are Asians that moved to America reaching adulthood. My mother simply does not believe in mental illness despite being a nurse. I was denied my medication and the only therapy that I was allowed to have was family therapy. I didn't want that to happen, so I quickly tried to shove such an idea under the carpet and it's been under the carpet ever since.
Now to more recent times, I had been okay throughout quarantine, but it struck me so randomly during the midst of October. School had already been happening for a couple months, and I had been ""okay"" as I could have been. I suddenly lost motivation. It disappeared. I am a senior in high school, so a lot of people think that it's just a bad case of senioritis  or me just being incredibly lazy, but... I don't think how I felt was normal or rather how I feel is normal. It's only gotten worse since then. It went from not having motivation to do homework to not having the will to even get out of bed and do normal everyday tasks. I stopped going to the school activity I'm involved in, because it felt like it wasted my time and only stressed me out, and I stopped going to school in person, because I'd be miserable. I also realized that sometimes I can't eat, and that really frustrates me. I enjoy eating, but for some reason if I do eat, I lose my appetite while doing so and I can't bring myself to continue eating. Even playing video games or hanging out with friends instills a feeling of guilt within me.
I did get help. I reached out to friends. They suggested I tell a teacher, so I did. My teacher ended up getting in contact with my counselor, and then I had a discussion with my counselor. All I can say is the discussion with my counselor was utter bull shit. ""But your grades are so good. I'm glad you're using ... to cope. I'm glad you have healthy coping habits,"" were things he said to me. Keep in mind that I told him that how I coped was taking immediate rewards over long term rewards in hopes to make me at least feel better in the moment.  
I decided then to talk to my sister, since the school adults really were no help to me. My sister is about 10 years older than me. I stayed over at her place for a night, and honestly it was the best I had felt in the past several weeks. She even did some research for me and said that she could potentially get me into therapy herself, and that she could talk to our parents on my behalf. 
However, days after, I cried at the notation that I was a scum bag and a useless person. In fact, I just cried recently. 
I am a lazy, poor excuse of a person. All I can do now a days is skip events, because I can barely bring myself to wake up every morning. My parents call me lazy and tell me I get easily defensive about things. I'm scared. I know that I have been sensitive lately. Little things tip me off the boat. Sarcastic jokes have gotten to me, making me think maybe I am a piece of shit. I'm scared that one day I'll yell at my parents. I'll yell at them and blame them, only to be yelled back at. I'm scared that I'll lash out on someone underserving and wallow in my own selfish self pity. 
I feel like I have no one to talk to. No one to confide in. I know there are people in my life such as my sister and brother, my friends, and maybe even my parents, but I feel so bothersome. What can they even do? Offer me the same lame ass advice that I have to push through? I know this is suppose to be my own battle, that no one can necessarily just whisk away how I feel, and that everyone who knows is trying their best to help me. I don't really deserve that help. It feels like it does nothing for me, nothing but make me feel more like a burden. I'm just tired of not understanding how people wake up every morning and even find the will to wake up and get out of bed. I know it's suppose to get better, but I don't know if I can even put in the work that makes it better. I have been working on finding a more efficient way to die aside from overdosing. I was thinking of finding a way to poison myself, which necessarily shouldn't be that hard. I would prefer something that doesn't make me wreck my car, so that it can still be of use to my family members. Life feels like work. Work that only leads to things that are unsatisfying and unrewarding, and more work. I have no ambitions, no motivation. I'm just something that exists, taking of space. One of the only things I ever wanted in life was to get married, but now I believe I'm unworthy of marriage. Relationships are a stressful two-way street. Other people are an entire entity you have to put your care into. I know it can be just as disappointing as everything else in life, so now I'm left with not a single thing. I know I'm only 17. I know there is suppose to be more to life. I know that I'm still young and it could be teenage angst, but why can't I even find the motivation to do anything but breathe? Why can't I do anything?

Kid is special needs, with high functioning autism and many serious health issues due to a chronic condition. I've battled depression since my twenties, but never felt the pain, sadness and overall tiredness I'm feeling lately. I try to convince myself life is worth living, but really, is not. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. The only reason I haven't killed myself is the kid. Their dad bailed and can't do that to them. But I also can't go on anymore, there's no joy left on me, just emptiness. I'm so done. I'm on antidepressants, anxiety meds, self medicate myself with weed most nights and the pain is still there. I have done countless therapies through my life but right now, I'm at my lowest. I don't know what to do. 

The kid is oppositional and defiant, having a tantrum every time I ask them to take their medicine, or go to pee (important for their health), pick up things, or anything really. I'm talking about at least 5-6 difficult tantrums every day. No one helps me, except for my mom who comes a couple of times a week to take care of kid while I'm working online. But there's really no escape from my situation, no possibilities of finding love again (I've tried and failed, mainly because having a disruptive kid), no way I'm holding my job for long because said kid will disrupt my classes and meetings because he's needy and gets bored easily. Kid is on many therapies, medicated, but still, a mess. Not their fault, and I love them more than anything in the world, but right now can't stand them. Can't stand the ingrate job it entails being a single mom of such a difficult child. Their therapist agrees this is not a solo job, but there's no one else to help me. And I'm done.

&amp;#x200B;

I posted a couple weeks ago I think about not having anyone, feeling like everyone hates me, hating my job, feeling insignificant. Lot of stuff around that. Well, I went home for Thanksgiving and my siblings, sister's husband, and parents were there. I did Nanowrimo this month and so Thanksgiving day I got up early and plugged my laptop in at the breakfast bar in the kitchen and started preparing my pumpkin roll batter so that I could type away while it was baking and work intermittently while I help with cooking. Well my brother came in and made a stink about the computer being there so my mom yelled at me to move it. I was in the middle of making the pumpkin roll so I was like no. It was made into a big thing and I got yelled at and told DON'T RUIN THANKSGIVING. Over my laptop being htere. I'm like I put it there because I want to use it. She said WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT. Because why the fuck else would I set it there?   


This is like the cliff notes version and it was a lot of stress and yelling and I just felt ganged up on, so keep in mind you are just reading a synopsis and there was tone, facial expressions, and all that jazz that you're not getting the context of. anyway, I cried for about an hour after that, begged my boyfriend to just leave with me and go home, but he said no, so I took a long shower. 

&amp;#x200B;

I go through the day and my sister and her husband get there. her and my brother always hang out and everyones talking, having fun. I just feel like an outsider the whole time. Basically holding in tears the whole time because I just hate myself and hate being in my own skin and hate that no one cares about me. So fast forward to the end of the night and I was talking to my mom and I broke down crying because the feeling of people not liking me, people not wanting me around was weighing on me. And she immediately just sighed and rolled her eyes and then started screaming at me ""YOU JUST WANT TO FIGHT. COLAFRANK ALWAYS WANTS TO FIGHT. COLAFRANK ALWAYS HAS TO BE RIGHT. YOU JUST WANT TO FIGHT."" And it made no sense to me why she was saying that. I was like no I'm just telling you how I feel, that I'm feeling down and sad. And shes like WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WHAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT WAY. And everytime I was like well it hurt me that you rolled your eyes or anything like that she would get defensive and bsically say that I was doing something wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still so confused by it because I don't know why she got so upset. She just started really gouging into me....We were screaming for like 2 hours and then she walked away and came back 5 minutes later and said something like you wanna talk about being mentally unstable try having your brother ask you to suck his dick and then talk about being mentally unstable. Like okay because I haven't been molested I can't express having negative feelings? My father was an alcoholic growing up my whole life. that is trauma too. 

&amp;#x200B;

And all I wanted to do was just talk to my mom about how I was feeling....for support...just someone to listen to me because I thought that was what mothers do. But I get yelled, invalidated, belittled, and then scolded because NO i cant feel bad EVER and WHY DON'T YOU GO TO YOUR DAD WITH THAT.

Most of the time, I can wall off my emotions and not feel them. I am never happy, but I can fake it and survive. I can have fleeting moments of peace but they're gone as fast as they come. 

My mental health is crumbling. I am struggling. I guess this post is a way of.. wanting help. 

I've only attempted suicide once. (It was years ago) And it was after months of relentless bullying. I asked for help for months leading up to it. Yet, I was written off as ""not a risk"". I seemed fairly okay in therapy meetings. I was making great grades. Æ and B's. Eating. Hanging with peers. My peers said I seemed okay. Despite my several references to wanting to die etc. 

I survived. I survived. When I returned to school, I was looked at like a freak. I remember several people joking that I wasn't good at dying either. Nothing I'm good at. 

As time went on, I learned to survive. I became better at walling off my emotions. Disassociating? A trauma response I started to learn as a child after being abused by a caregiver. After watching my parents abuse each other. After being sexually assaulted more than once. After years of being bullied in school, of being an outsider. 

I've had depression since I was fairly young. 

No, I don't have any plans of dying. I don't want to ""die"" and I'm not even sure I wanted to when I tried. But I am tired of hurting and eventually you can't take it anymore. And you can't breathe and the flames are on ya so you have to jump out of that hypothetical burning building even though you don't want to. But the smoke is choking you. 

Every time I break, the walls of my resolve fall and I spend hours crying (and feeling the emotions that have always been there) and every time I manage to pick up those fractured pieces and tape myself together, it gets harder. I lose of piece of myself every time. 

Fractured. And blown away. Harder to tape back together as the holes keep getting bigger and bigger. 

I really question how often I can keep doing this. I've spent years in countless therapy offices. I've been placed on so many medications, and I don't feel good. I don't feel good. 

I'm always told how strong I am because I've survived what I survived, but would people really say that if they knew how I feel? 

Most of the time I am numb. Disassociated from the pain inside my head. How do you feel? People sometimes ask. Well, I know you wouldn't know how to handle the information if I gave it to you but wait until the door opens and I feel emotion again

Because I've built this impossibly tall, thick wall I've been working on since childhood that I've wrapped around myself to protect me. It's a survival tactic. The wall has kept me alive this long, but I question how long it can. 

You're wary of people. People say. Yes I am. My parents were abusive but subtly so. They didn't hit me but they hurt me in other ways. They hurt each other and I saw it. My teacher used to be physically abusive. 

Both of my parents suffer from mental health issues. I never learned how to handle the predisposition to mental illness I was genetically born with and did end up developing. Emotions? We don't know her. Hide it away. 

I feel so alone. And I know everyone around me wouldn't miss me. Will I ever feel okay?

The thought of suicide is always in my mind it's just a matter of how intense it is. I spend 100% of my days struggling to distract my mind from all the depressing thoughts but it never works long term. 
I'm still in debate if I had a suicide attempt a week ago, I'm not entirely sure but I wish I did it back then. It's been seven or so days since then which means there has been seven or so breakdowns since then. 
I can list off a million reasons why I hate my life, truthfully a lot of you have it worse here, but I can fight and change every aspect of my life but honestly it won't make me happy. I truly believe there is nothing that can change me. 
If I spend 30 minutes thinking about my future I have a breakdown. But all the stresses about my future and everything goes away when I realize I can kill myself. I've been rationalizing suicide for months now and one part of me is thinking it's awful that I'm taking a life ending action and thinking it's not half bad but the other part of me is doubling down on that thought. I already have it planned out, I already have it setup, I'm just waiting for something to push me over the edge. 
I'm not going to kill myself tonight granted, but I don't see myself living another full year. I feel completely hopeless and helpless and if one more person suggests that all this can be fixed by going on a fucking walk I'm going to lose it.

,SuicideWatch,"I've been contemplating for a while now and I think I'm ready to go. Everything has been so stressful lately, that I can't handle it anymore.

I just turned 16 a little over a month ago. I was fine about a year and a half ago. When I went into high school, everyone had super high expectations for me. During my freshman year I was taking sophomore and junior level classes, doubling up class periods and taking extra school sports. By the time my freshman year had finished, I had completed 10 out of 22 required credits to graduate. All A's, and at the top of my class. 

Once this year started, it was all online. I was losing motivation and I felt like there was no point. Every day was the same routine, it was wake up, join a zoom, call, and log off. I stopped actually doing my work and missing assignments were piling up. I was giving up on trying to get all A's cause I don't care anymore.

My mom still expects me to get all A's and won't stop getting on me about it. I've told her I don't care about being top of the class, and I just want to pass my classes. She is a teacher at my school and is constantly emailing my teachers about my work and I get in trouble if I have below a 90% in any class. As soon as I get one missing assignment, I lose all my electronics and she sits and watches me finish it.

About six weeks I decided to finally give up for good. I stopped turning in any work at all. I sat on my Chromebook all day, barely paying attention to the teacher and what we were learning. I can't tell you anything that I've learned this year. No of my teachers seem to care, just my mother. My father is on her side, that I need to pass the class, but I know he is only saying that to agree with her. He didn't care about me when me, my mom and my sister almost got evicted.

With finals coming up and all my work being due in by Friday, I don't think its worth trying. It probably seems silly and stupid that I'm contemplating killing myself over school work, but its not just school work. Its the yelling from my parents and the disappointment I see when they talk to me. As their elides daughter, they expect so much more from me and I'm a failure for not being able to achieve that.

I don't think I'll miss my friends. I've already written them letters, and I hope they can understand it's not their fault. I don't want them to feel guilty for not being able to help, it's not their fault in any way. I don't want them to feel like they could've done more.

&lt;p&gt;I just fucking wish Europe wasn’t so troublesome to own a gun. I’ve always told myself to end it with some gun if I’m ever able to get my hands on one, but those chances are so slim to none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just in some purgatory now of having to wait for that opportunity. I just don’t want to feel any pain and want to be sure it’s instant, too many methods are too risky for me. I don’t want to end up in a hospital whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fucking god I don’t understand how &amp;amp; why I’m still carrying through all this if I’m so set on dying anyways, suppose it’s the indirect pressure of my family.&lt;/p&gt;

I sh often, but not deep. Usually I either scratch/lightly cut with scissors, or i scratch myself with my fingernails till I bleed.

I was 13 when I self harmed the first time. My friend had attempted suicide and was in the hospital. I was freaking out, convinced it was my fault. I had been helping her through her journey with depression, since her parents were distant and refused to get her professional help. We had a fight, we made up (so i thought) and a few days later she was found bleeding and unconscious on her floor, with a pair of scissors next to her. Its really all a bit fuzzy now, but i know she went to the hospital and is doing better now. That night was when i cut for the first time. I thought it was all my fault that she'd attempted. I tried to hang myself. I tied the rope wrong and it broke. No permanent damage, so i saw no reason to tell anyone.

I've just entered high school, and I know very few people at my school. Ive felt so alone. I turned to the internet to see if I could find anyone at all who would care for me and be my friend. I needed someone who I couldnt lose due to school changes.

Recently I started talking to these AMAZING people online. Thanks to them, I was clean for longer than i wouldve been. When we met, I was around 40 days. That streak lasted to around 3 months. Then something happened that caused me to relapse. My online friends helped me through it and helped me push myself to put my scissors away and work towards getting clean again.

She deleted my discord. I was able to contact these people through reddit, but it wasnt the same. It isnt the same.

,SuicideWatch,"I've been in a downward depression spiral over the past few weeks, mainly over the question: ""Am I a good person?"" I'm now 26, and I've definitely made some mistakes in my adulthood that have been hard to forgive myself for. 

Last night, though, it culminated in me deciding to go through my Facebook from high school years, and what I found has made me absolutely sick to my stomach and feeling more strongly like I deserve to die than I ever have before. 

For context, I'm white and went to a mostly white Catholic school. I befriended a girl senior year that I tried to be really edgy and funny with. Things I would absolutely never even think of these days (i.e. we basically had a burn book for people we thought were gross/ugly/fat. Many of whom never did anything to us, which breaks my heart to think about). 

However, in my memory most of this vileness was contained to our private conversations. Last night, though, I found (PUBLIC) posts from 8-10 years ago like: 

* ""Yo n\*g!"" (calling each other that) 
* A song we wrote about Jewish people and posted (neither of us are Jewish). 
* Generally a LOT of ""Jew"" comments back and forth. I guess we had called each other that for fun. A lot of stupid, immature stereotype jokes, too, like about pennies, noses, etc. 
* A post where we were bashing our AP English professor for her summary of ""Heart of Darkness,"" where I said she'd just say ""black people and jungle love"" (I don't know if I was quoting her or just making a quick racist interpretation).  
* Nasty comments about someone we called ""troll"" (I literally don't even know who it is we were talking about). 

I spent the entire night sobbing and vomiting. Since college, I've tried to actively educate myself on the hardships of marginalized people and how to be a better ally. So when I found this, it was like seeing someone else had hacked my account--I truly don't even recognize this person. 

And I have no idea what my motive was for posting these types of things publicly. I guess I was trying to be funny. I was definitely not cool in high school, so I suppose I thought no one would see them or was paying attention. I was kind of like the middle-level between popular and outcast, and I think it turned me into a monster trying to get noticed and be liked. 

I wouldn't even know where to begin with making amends--I did have friends who were Jewish and POC outside of my high school, and I'm not sure if they saw this or not. I don't want to blindly reach out to people and assume they saw it. What would I even say? How could I tell them I'm not a monster anymore? 

I really can't live with myself knowing there are probably some people out there--high school acquaintances, former friends, etc.--that know me for these racist remarks. I have contemplated suicide for years, but I've never felt so intensely ready to do it, like it's my only option.

But she won't ever let me touch her outside of that, or cuddle, or do anything else intimate, up to and including really having any conversations about anything, serious or non serious.

Like, I am obviously trapped because if I left I wouldn't be able to find anyone new in a pandemic, and if we got divorced the court would give her all of my income and leave me homeless(Per several subreddits on here) (Edit: Those subreddits appear to be pretty misogyny filled now that I’m looking through them so I don’t really trust their take on things..)   so no one would want to date me anyway because I would just be a broke, lonely fuck in my 30's.

So basically I am trapped and unhappy, because I don't want to leave the relationship if I can't find someone new (And spare me the ""You only need yourself"" crap, that sounds a lot like someone trying to politely tell me I will be alone forever if I leave, and is NOT what I need right now, and part of why I want to die).

,SuicideWatch,"I had a mental breakdown a year ago. I used to smoke way too much weed (5 spliffs per day) and cigarettes (15 per day) and I ate extremely unhealthy too for 9 years. On top of that I had just lived life without thinking clearly and just lived in the moment. I became suicidal because I was so shocked at why my past self didn't just fucking live healthy like I've been doing for the last 2 years. My mind was set on killing myself.

Then I contact my ex who I dumped and she blocked me. In some random, dumb, depressed, idiotic, life-ruining impulse I made a new account and wrote extremely suicidal texts to her. She said she had improved a lot and I said. 'Fuck improving. I'm done with life. Pointless bullshit anyway. You still want my cat?'...

After that she got angry. I start to explain it. She engages, but then blocks me. This happens like 8 times. After a while she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards'. Then I reply that I did change because I hit the gym 6 times per week, eat extremely healthy, quit smoking, graduated and starting my career. That's her cue to explode. She writes an extremely mean message filled with hate, disdain and degrading stuff. 'You'll never learn how to live your life' 'Loser' 'Whiner' 'Tragic' 'Forecasting that you're going to die? I don't fucking care!' 'This is the same irrational behavior as at that concert when you were arguing with random ppl'... She also told me she would never reply again.

Then it becomes chaos in my head. It was already chaos, but after that it just went overboard. I hate those insults so much. They repeat in my head all the time. I can't cope with it. I'm too emotionally weak already. I struggled to recover from my suicidal thoughts and this on top of it was too much. Like I just started screaming out of agony after I read those words for the first time... 'You'll never learn how to live your life'... Constantly repeating in my head. Flashbacks to arguing at that concert. Feeling even worse about myself.

Initially fucking HATED her! She was 8 years older and came into my life and I never asked for it and then she can't even bring herself to end it without a bunch of insults that are so toxic for my mental health at that time!

After that I changed though. I started to realize that I was in the wrong. I changed my tone and began explaining all the time. Begging to talk it out. I did this for like 4 to 5 months because I couldn't think of anything else. In the end I wrote an extremely personal e-mail to her workmail that got forwarded to her co-workers in which I called myself a piece of shit and more dramatic stuff like saying 'begging the universe I'm still on time'... 😓 I fully took the blame in that one. I still had one weak moment and wrote another message like a month later to her LinkedIn and that was it.

I hate myself. I can't believe that this has happened. I hate that this is part of my life story. I feel like I should kill myself sometimes because I can't stand myself. I'm so ashamed of myself.

I’ve only shared my thoughts of suicide in private, but things have been getting really difficult and wanted to hear what other people do in their own life to fight thoughts of suicide. Not necessarily looking for help or tips but just to hear other people’s experiences. 

For those interested I’ll include some background: I deal with sex addiction and recently my ex found out that I had been cheating on them, amongst other allegations. Due to that I lost all my friends, my job, and I’m essentially ostracized from anyone in my community outside my recovery support system. I’ve dealt with thoughts of suicide for a long time but these feelings have been exacerbated by these issues, isolation, the seasons changing, COVID, and the fact that my ex has repeatedly told me to “do the world a favor and kill myself”. Put it simply, I’m really struggling. 

For me what has helped fight hopelessness has been:
- make lists of reasons NOT to kill my self, including anything silly that makes me feel even slightly happier 
- hiking and connecting with nature 
- being mindful about the things I cook/eat
- being more mindful about my body and health, recently started doing yoga and more exercise

Even my own half brother was grimey towards me because Toya made it seem like it was my fault that i left like i can make decisions at 3 or 4 years old. Was turned on to weed by my own little brother and i allowed him to take advantage of me. In the end everyone was waiting on my downfall. I hate you too Ari. I was never close to them tbh. I felt like a stranger, a step kid that you see every now and again. Yea i did alot of fucked up shit. Alot of sick shit. I ll take that but i didnt do it for no reason. My anger and hatred for everyone in that family grew once she died. Now i made it to where since i fucked up so bad, these 2 demons in sheeps clothing is off scott free living their best life while every day i sleep outside finding inexpensive ways to kill myself with no success. Im going to get arrested because im going on a rampage before this year is over. I just wanted to say this:Before I die (because i will be dead before them) I just want them to know I hate every single one you. You can hate me now but my hatred for you all runs deep. AND IF I SEE ANYONE OF YOU THAT SO CALLED FAMILY, YALL BETTER KILL ME OR DONT SAY A WORD TO ME! YALL WON! INSTEAD OF ABORTING ME, SELFISHLY BOUGHT ME INTO THIS WORLD. AND Ari you evil mf...you always thought i was the winner as well as others but your mom is still alive, my mom and dad (my grandma) is dead. I would of never had the relationship u and Toya have. I curse every single one of you every day. I ll hate all of you until the day i die and go to hell. Fuck God Fuck Jesus and fuck all yall in that family. I ll forever be a stranger and an abomination. I hope all of you see this+&lt;/p&gt;

So you know the situation we are in let's jump to present time. In class we made grups of friends and all. Everything seems fine. But. One of our big group of 3 is acting weird. I mean I don't know him for long, and there are people that just like that kind of stuff, but... He keeps talking about death, once he wrote a poem on class messenger group that seemed like a sad love backstory, and it looks like he blames himself for whatever happened then. He is very antisocial and introvertic, keeps making death jokes and lastly he went mad at me and second friend for no reason but he came back after half a hour and he said he is fine now.

I try to keep my eye on him, but I think that if something will happen I will be powerless to help so I don't want him to feel lonely. Also I am stepping on a thin line now. I don't know what will happen to me if he will actually try to end his life. Most friends left and gossiped about me for no reason. No contact with my elementary school class. I was the one that found my grandma dead at her house. Only friends I have are these two from my current class and one or two bois that I just know for long. If these people will leave me. I will be all by myself. For now I am stubborn as hell and when somebody tries to insult me I am like ""who are you to make me feel bad, I am not worse than you"" but I don't know for how long will that stand for me.

,SuicideWatch,"A year ago someone messaged me on Reddit responding to my r4r post asking if they were interested in talking. We talked and we got on very well, they lived on the west coast of the US and I am in the UK so obviously distance was a factor.

We got on so well so quickly we talked about meeting up, but just at the end of the call she started crying, saying she had herpes so if I was disgusted by that then I did not have to talk to her or meet her if I didn't want too. But I still gave her a chance.

Fast forward a month or two I spent a week with her and I had an amazing time, I like I was with someone I could spend the rest of my life with even after the short time we knew each other and she said she felt the same way. I come back to the UK and we speak pretty much every day. She was so easy to speak too and was so beautiful I felt so lucky.

Covid came around so I could not meet her again until this whole situation was sorted, I granted was finding it hard because I felt very lonely maintaining this LDR, I even said I wanted to sleep around because I had that urge but I never ended up doing anything because I would feel so guilty if I did.

My plan was to meet up again and we could build up from where we left off, we had a few mishaps here and there but no major problems were ever told to me so I assumed everything was okay.

Then we had a call and she basically just said she could not do this anymore, she had a lot of bottled feelings about how she was scared she would pass over the STI to me which would hurt me being an immunosuppressant person having done a transplant and we just had a very emotional phone call.

I then find a text the morning after expressing her guilt how someone I knew for 8 plus years went behind my back to ask her out after we had this phone call and she said yes. This was someone I spoke too on discord and I introduced her too as someone to talk too so she had some company when I went to sleep or if I was not around because I knew she was quite lonely herself.

This is what hurts me the most, she went behind my back straight after our phone call and continued to pursue this interest from someone who went behind back and knowing how it would affect me.

For the main mistake I made saying what I said, I did alot of good for her, I never once lied to her about anything, I listened to her troubles with life and work, I lost countless hours of sleep to stay up and talk to her with the 8 hour time difference. I gave her a chance even after her telling me her condition and this is how I get repaid.

I have been bullied in the past throughout high school, my father used to beat me and I have a lot of general problems in life so I have always had suicidal thoughts.

&lt;p&gt;Then we had a call and she basically just said she could not do this anymore, she had a lot of bottled feelings about how she was scared she would pass over the STI to me which would hurt me being an immunosuppressant person having done a transplant and we just had a very emotional phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then find a text the morning after expressing her guilt how someone I knew for 8 plus years went behind my back to ask her out after we had this phone call and she said yes. This was someone I spoke too on discord and I introduced her too as someone to talk too so she had some company when I went to sleep or if I was not around because I knew she was quite lonely herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what hurts me the most, she went behind my back straight after our phone call and continued to pursue this interest from someone who went behind back and knowing how it would affect me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the main mistake I made saying what I said, I did alot of good for her, I never once lied to her about anything, I listened to her troubles with life and work, I lost countless hours of sleep to stay up and talk to her with the 8 hour time difference. I gave her a chance even after her telling me her condition and this is how I get repaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been bullied in the past throughout high school, my father used to beat me and I have a lot of general problems in life so I have always had suicidal thoughts. This one, I just feel like any light I had left has just been taken out. I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically i wanted to die since when i was about 6 or 7. I don't really know what to do anymore i have tried to kms 7 times this month, and no imnot joking i was dumped and i felt really depressed, suicidal and just.. Not good in any way.

I haven't really been doing anything productive. All i did this weekend was cry when i was alone, stay in my room, isolate myself and look at youtube until late in the night. Ive been getting pretty desperate now because i want to die. Like seriously kms but i can't because my friends wouldn't let me do that.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm asking this here because it seems to be the only sub where I can ask suicide-related questions without getting banned. I know this might look of bad taste for suicidal people, but please read me out. For a long, long time I've been contemplating suicide, but I just don't have the guts to do it. I lack the necessary impulsiveness.

My whole life I've been an outcast. I searched for meaningful connections in high school, in church, in college, in a lot of extracurricular activities, but I never found them. But that changed a few months ago. I found a group of friends who seemed to genuinely care for me and loved me, and for a few months, it seemed like life could be something more than loneliness and despair. But then, Covid arrived and my mental health just couldn't handle the quarantine (I'm not from the US. My country has very strict quarantine measures), and I alienated them from my life by being a fucking piece of shit (I know it sounds like an excuse, but so many years of being a loner really fucked me up and it's really, really hard for me to behave empathically, and the isolation didn't help at all). 

For a few days during July, I ended up without a cellphone, and they all freaked out when I didn't answered because they were certain I had killed myself, so I know I can get them back if they believe that this time I actually tried to. I know this is manipulative and unscrupulous, but I really can't think of other ways to get them back (Yeah, I tried talking with them and apologizing. It didn't work). This time around I wouldn't be a shitty friend. I would respect them and give my everything to make them feel valued and loved.

So, I'm asking if there are ways to make it look like I tried to kill myself but failed.

I know this might look of bad taste for suicidal people, but please read me out. For a long, long time I&amp;#39;ve been contemplating suicide, but I just don&amp;#39;t have the guts to do it. I lack the necessary impulsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My whole life I&amp;#39;ve been an outcast. I searched for meaningful connections in high school, in church, in college, in a lot of extracurricular activities, but I never found them. But that changed a few months ago. I found a group of friends who seemed to genuinely care for me and loved me, and for a few months, it seemed like life could be something more than loneliness and despair. But then, Covid arrived and my mental health just couldn&amp;#39;t handle the quarantine (I&amp;#39;m not from the US. My country has very strict quarantine measures), and I alienated them from my life by being a fucking piece of shit (I know it sounds like an excuse, but so many years of being a loner really fucked me up and it&amp;#39;s really, really hard for me to behave empathically, and the isolation didn&amp;#39;t help at all). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few days during July, I ended up without a cellphone, and they all freaked out when I didn&amp;#39;t answered because they were certain I had killed myself, so I know I can get them back if they believe that this time I actually tried to. I know this is manipulative and unscrupulous, but I really can&amp;#39;t think of other ways to get them back (Yeah, I tried talking with them and apologizing. It didn&amp;#39;t work). This time around I wouldn&amp;#39;t be a shitty friend. I would respect them and give my everything to make them feel valued and loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m asking if there are ways to make it look like I tried to kill myself but failed. Maybe I can cut my forearm in a way I don&amp;#39;t cut any arteries and make it look like I missed cause I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was doing, or take some pills that would only knock me out for a day and make it look like I failed to kill myself cause I don&amp;#39;t know anything about chemestry (I genuinely don&amp;#39;t). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can berate me all you want, I know I deserve it, but please help me. You don&amp;#39;t have any idea how lonely my life has been and how much of a loser i feel like cause I finally got what I&amp;#39;ve craved my whole life, but I fucked it up by being me.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hello Redditors!

This is my first time reaching out to this community and I'm fairly new here, but I believe I need some help, because I think I'm close to my breaking point.

I've been suffering from depression for a few years now and a LOT of things happened during this time. Amazing and horrible things. Almost 2 years ago I went to try out Reiki, hoping, that it might ease my depression, but surprisingly, it only made it worse, and ever since that time I did a shit load of things to  make myself better. I met new people, discovered a lot about myself, but I'm still suffering.

I know I'm a strong person who is capable of going through hell and back, but I lost my hope within myself. The thing is, I hear voices. No, I'm not psychotic, no I'm not schizpohrenic, nothing of that sort. I just simply hear them, mostly ever since Reiki. If there is one thing you learn from my story and experience, is that energetic healing can be EXTREMELY dangerous and if you ever happen to choose this route, make sure that the person is a 100% person trustworthy and knows what he is doing, otherwise he can f\*ck up your energetic system.

I have a doctor and thankfully, a great energetic healer next to me... but in the end, it all comes down to me, and I have zero energy left to deal with the problem and the fact, that my recovery solely depends on me is frightening and amazing at the same time. I'm just... drowning, and yes, I feel suicidal, because the pain is too much. The voices are always at the back of my mind, telling me that I'm worthless, that I should kill myself, I will never recover and I will forever stick with them... and a houndred other things.  


I'm not sure how to proceed... I had so much drive, so much inner strength, determination a year ago, I truly believed I could move mountains and overcome everything, but right now... I feel like I can't even move a pencil. I'm so, so angry and disappointed within myself, because I know there are so much more within me, but I can't find that ""me"" right now. On top of that, I know I have a shitload of things to work on myself, on my personality, but I simply don't have the energy... and I feel so alone. I mean I know I'm not, because I have there professionals and my family around me and yet, I feel so  lonely and numb, empty. I love my family, don't get me wrong, but they just simply don't know how to express their love, because hey weren't taught how to. Me, on the other hand... I would give everything for someone to hug me, and tell me, that everything's going to be okay, just do your best, or something like that, especially since the voices are telling me that I'm all alone in this world.

It's so fucking hard. I don't want to die, because I know I have a beautiful life awaiting for me, but I don't know if I can get from point A to point B, so too often I feel like that it's my only reasonable option.

If anyone can give me an advice, how did you get the energy to deal with the problem? The energetic healer told me that I should walk in the nearby forest as much as I could, but some days I can't even bring myself to do that, and than I  just become frustrated, because I know I'm capable of so much more deep down.

I just don't understand how is it possible? I'm not blaming anyone and I don't want to make people guilty but that reasoning helped me a lot through my toughest times. I really didn't have anything in my life that was worth but I KNEW that I didn't want to destroy and pass my depression to my loved ones even if that meant still having to carry that awful depression. At the time I considered myself lucky to know that I had people that loved me dearly and I know now that some people really don't have the knowledge that maybe someone else loves them but even if you don't know that you must think about the fact that maybe someone that you think doesn't care about you actually does and will be destroyed when you take your life and will probably depress them as much as you were.

,SuicideWatch,"Today’s my birthday. I don’t even know what to say. As a kid I rejoiced growing up but now I would do anything just to be a carefree kid again. Months upon months I’ve been alone. I’m failing at school. No one cares about me. All my ‘friends’ are fake. They all hang out without me and make plans behind my back. They think I don’t know but they talk shit about me when I’m not around as well. I feel like my family don’t even know me. My parents split up not too long ago and I never get to see my father. Also, as a result of this I barely ever get to see either of my siblings because they mostly live at his house and I find it hard to visit because of my busy schedule with school. 

Sometimes I feel like this is how my life will be forever. Since 2014 I haven’t felt consistent happiness, just pockets of hope here and there. Every time I think I’m progressing I just get sent back to the start. My life is constant emotional turmoil and grief. It takes so much just to produce a smile. I’ve been like this for years. I can’t keep pretending I’m ok. All the time I search up the locations of bridges and think about jumping off them. Or, equally I search up how much rope costs at the local hardware store in case I want to hang myself. The only thing I can think of now is to either stab myself with the largest knife I can find in the kitchen or to overdose on sleeping tablets. 

I hate telling myself that things will get better because they never do. Whenever things were finally looking up for me (late 2019) the pandemic happened and of course any sign of emotional recovery I had had been crushed. Everyday I wake up, alone. I eat meals, alone. I sleep, alone. No one ever asks how I’m doing. No one cares about my life. If I died right now, no one would care. Even if they did they would forget about me soon enough. I’m nobody’s best friend. Hell, I’m not even anyone’s friend to begin with. The latter years of my childhood have just been filled with emotional devastation. Where did I ever go wrong? How did I let myself get this lonely?

I’m not normal. Everyone else has a normal life. I don’t doubt that other people struggle but I know they don’t feel anything close to the amount of pain I feel. I feel like I’m going insane living this same stupid life where every single day is a carbon copy of the last. I just wish I had some people that cared about me and wanted me to be alive. People who wanted to hang out. People who ask how I am. I would do the same, deep down I’m a good hearted person. I want to see everyone succeed and be happy. But it seems that no one reciprocates that energy with me. 

I can feel the void returning. I’m genuinely terrified of being alone forever. The emotional numbness is coming back and my nightmares are coming true. 

Right now I’m just listening to some Kid Cudi crying my eyes out. My life is literally worthless. What is my purpose? To suffer daily?

I’m sorry In advance.",t2_5bcw7dx8,False,,0,False,My birthday is today. I want to take my own life.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k2xrcu,False,dark,1.0,,public,44,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,44,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606633433.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s my birthday. I don’t even know what to say. As a kid I rejoiced growing up but now I would do anything just to be a carefree kid again. Months upon months I’ve been alone. I’m failing at school. No one cares about me. All my ‘friends’ are fake. They all hang out without me and make plans behind my back. They think I don’t know but they talk shit about me when I’m not around as well. I feel like my family don’t even know me. My parents split up not too long ago and I never get to see my father. Also, as a result of this I barely ever get to see either of my siblings because they mostly live at his house and I find it hard to visit because of my busy schedule with school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like this is how my life will be forever. Since 2014 I haven’t felt consistent happiness, just pockets of hope here and there. Every time I think I’m progressing I just get sent back to the start. My life is constant emotional turmoil and grief. It takes so much just to produce a smile. I’ve been like this for years. I can’t keep pretending I’m ok. All the time I search up the locations of bridges and think about jumping off them. Or, equally I search up how much rope costs at the local hardware store in case I want to hang myself. The only thing I can think of now is to either stab myself with the largest knife I can find in the kitchen or to overdose on sleeping tablets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate telling myself that things will get better because they never do. Whenever things were finally looking up for me (late 2019) the pandemic happened and of course any sign of emotional recovery I had had been crushed. Everyday I wake up, alone. I eat meals, alone. I sleep, alone. No one ever asks how I’m doing. No one cares about my life. If I died right now, no one would care. Even if they did they would forget about me soon enough. I’m nobody’s best friend. Hell, I’m not even anyone’s friend to begin with. The latter years of my childhood have just been filled with emotional devastation. Where did I ever go wrong? How did I let myself get this lonely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not normal. Everyone else has a normal life. I don’t doubt that other people struggle but I know they don’t feel anything close to the amount of pain I feel. I feel like I’m going insane living this same stupid life where every single day is a carbon copy of the last. I just wish I had some people that cared about me and wanted me to be alive. People who wanted to hang out. People who ask how I am. I would do the same, deep down I’m a good hearted person. I want to see everyone succeed and be happy. But it seems that no one reciprocates that energy with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel the void returning. I’m genuinely terrified of being alone forever. The emotional numbness is coming back and my nightmares are coming true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m just listening to some Kid Cudi crying my eyes out. My life is literally worthless. What is my purpose? To suffer daily? I did a quick google search about people stabbing themselves and came across this subreddit. I don’t know if this post is even welcome here but I’ve said everything on mind. I’m sorry In advance.&lt;/p&gt;

I fake my personality 24/7, this includes peers and family members, leading onto me losing my desires, goals, and purpose to live - since I don’t even know them. i use to be a bright child, my parents would go into fights now and then and, I was able to help them get through it. I was always so optimistic, caring, loveable And ‘cute’. Always considerably popular, and even if I wasn’t I had great friends. But as I grow up and continue to fake my personality I’ve grown a repetition, to which people rather expect me to do their own work, always be right, have great advices and give people answers. Recently, this has been going downhill but the stigma is still there. Many people know my name but, I cant live it up anymore which I don’t feel subjected to... but I feel like it’s a part of the reason I’m here. Highschool is what led me to expand on these sad thoughts, this could also be my lack in Serotonin since, I have a hard knot upon my shoulders which cause chronic pain - can also cause migraines and tension headaches. At such a young age, for myself many people around me are trying to figure out  themselves and have such a positive attitude towards their future.   


I truly wonder if it’s my friends that cause this, recently we were having a ‘debate’ which I had to jokingky insert so none Of my emotions would be subjected. As my friends stated that we should all just result in dying since this will solve our pain in knowing what to do in life, the struggle of school work, but as I was trying to be optimistic and I touched on the base of reproduction. This basically was about how our future generation will hopefully find answers to many unsolvable questions in today’s work but, they rebutted that there is a no benfit in doing so... which I agreed. However, they harshly stated that I should stick with one passion - and I’m rather a perspective person. And I also wonder why I don’t stick with one passion. or why I don’t have a passion like other. You see one of my Friends dream to be a fashion designer, but in influence of an career test and parents she wants to be a doctor. I question whether if it’s her own choice, she said ‘yes’ but I don’t really think so... even if this is based off a few of my friends. Their opinions and agreement within each other has led me to my loneliness. It’s not entirely their Fault and I’ve felt this way forever...

Highschool is what led me to expand on these sad thoughts, this could also be my lack in Serotonin since, I have a hard knot upon my shoulders which cause chronic pain - can also cause migraines and tension headaches. At such a young age, for myself many people around me are trying to figure out  themselves and have such a positive attitude towards their future.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly wonder if it’s my friends that cause this, recently we were having a ‘debate’ which I had to jokingky insert so none Of my emotions would be subjected. As my friends stated that we should all just result in dying since this will solve our pain in knowing what to do in life, the struggle of school work, but as I was trying to be optimistic and I touched on the base of reproduction. This basically was about how our future generation will hopefully find answers to many unsolvable questions in today’s work but, they rebutted that there is a no benfit in doing so... which I agreed. However, they harshly stated that I should stick with one passion - and I’m rather a perspective person. And I also wonder why I don’t stick with one passion. or why I don’t have a passion like other. You see one of my Friends dream to be a fashion designer, but in influence of an career test and parents she wants to be a doctor. I question whether if it’s her own choice, she said ‘yes’ but I don’t really think so... even if this is based off a few of my friends. Their opinions and agreement within each other has led me to my loneliness. It’s not entirely their Fault and I’ve felt this way forever... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im too tired. goodnight  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this text isn’t rather energy inputted as my deleted one, I hope this is able to release something for myself. To which I will write more of this stuff when I feel this negative and sad... peace out reddit. And ofc my future self if I read this again.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"So I've been depressed for around 10 years and suicidal for around 7 years (I was gonna do it then but didn't because I wanted to see the future.. as you can see it is bad). I've been to a psychiatrist and diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and bipolar. Thought I have to disagree with the last part tbh as with most symptoms I just don't think I match. I know I shouldn't self diagnose but the psychiatrist was from what I remember new. But also I'm not extreme and I do fairly well in school. Or did.. 

Anyways this as you can tell has been piling up ever sense. I don't take medication as I only went once and I regret going to the psychiatrists or therapist again, because when I did everyone seem to have saw me different. It was out of the blue as typically I have stifled it and was just seen as weird or crazy but now they see me even more as weird and crazy.

I have no friends so the ones at least in real life and online is just a few (2 friends willing to give advice, though 1 is a bit religious so it doesn't helps as someone who isn't exactly.) The ones who saw me as such were mainly parental figures and other people in relation and peers in classes. And I don't want to tell them anymore private things.. and I can't.. Only people I trust is online folks because I was raised with technology and people there so it's a comfort at least. One of my escapes as well as art and gaming. I was always seen as bad in school because I'm always in my head and now I'm not so much. Still am but I managed to find a schedule and multitask it. 

That's one of the things too is that I can't stop my mind from running and I tend to move around a lot quite unwillingly and lose my focus a bit too easily so thinking straight and dealing with 1 issue isn't so easy for me. Becomes a 1 issue into a million issues and tangents. I also seem to suffer from a lot of nostalgia that tends to bring me down then up and rather makes me feel like a failure and I do quite bad with it. Sometimes I start shaking and hyperventilating when I get so far. Also my personality and style seems to change a lot more than I like and I can't stop it, but there are always things that connect at least. I used to not remember anything not until I went full fledge to trying and doing so hurts my brain and I get headaches over trying, yeah. Things that always stuck with me is stuff like death and scary things though it seems. An interest such as art and gaming.

So now as someone who was born not connecting to my body and the social conforms of them. Life was never a choice and even if so, it's not one I'm grateful for. But I find killing myself is and one I was saving for later but idk what to do now and am really stuck with wanting to give in and or keep going. Idk how ima do it tbh. But I have found something worth it for doing so and that's, it's a bit dumb ig but, finding out about which afterlife theory is real. Finding the truth in that, what sucks is not being able to pass it down... I don't have any belief of my own tho so I won't bet (if I could) which would be real.




TLDR: I'm stuck and I suck at life. I'm a bit mental and quite literally alone (real life). I need some advice on where to go about this and whether or not I should die. I'm not confident in myself and feel like an alien/monster to even keep going on.




Edit: Some things that keep me going is art (any sorts really), gaming, going outside to the wooded and mountainous areas, fantasizing in things like space, science, and the sky. Writing scripts/making stories and watching new videos. Browsing the web and finding weird stuff. 
In general, distractions.

By looking forward to the future I meant as in changes, primarily changes in lifestyle, as in getting more friends at that time and being better and changing things to be good. I don't believe in everything should be good though. Mainly wanting a balance, bad things are great and nothing is black and white to me but grey. Lately been finding things to be too bad, obviously as to why.. 

I know things can and will get more balanced out but honestly I don't think I care anymore to see it and as the specs of dust we are in space. Don't think it's important too.

&lt;p&gt;I have no friends so the ones at least in real life and online is just a few (2 friends willing to give advice, though 1 is a bit religious so it doesn&amp;#39;t helps as someone who isn&amp;#39;t exactly.) The ones who saw me as such were mainly parental figures and other people in relation and peers in classes. And I don&amp;#39;t want to tell them anymore private things.. and I can&amp;#39;t.. Only people I trust is online folks because I was raised with technology and people there so it&amp;#39;s a comfort at least. One of my escapes as well as art and gaming. I was always seen as bad in school because I&amp;#39;m always in my head and now I&amp;#39;m not so much. Still am but I managed to find a schedule and multitask it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s one of the things too is that I can&amp;#39;t stop my mind from running and I tend to move around a lot quite unwillingly and lose my focus a bit too easily so thinking straight and dealing with 1 issue isn&amp;#39;t so easy for me. Becomes a 1 issue into a million issues and tangents. I also seem to suffer from a lot of nostalgia that tends to bring me down then up and rather makes me feel like a failure and I do quite bad with it. Sometimes I start shaking and hyperventilating when I get so far. Also my personality and style seems to change a lot more than I like and I can&amp;#39;t stop it, but there are always things that connect at least. I used to not remember anything not until I went full fledge to trying and doing so hurts my brain and I get headaches over trying, yeah. Things that always stuck with me is stuff like death and scary things though it seems. An interest such as art and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now as someone who was born not connecting to my body and the social conforms of them. Life was never a choice and even if so, it&amp;#39;s not one I&amp;#39;m grateful for. But I find killing myself is and one I was saving for later but idk what to do now and am really stuck with wanting to give in and or keep going. Idk how ima do it tbh. But I have found something worth it for doing so and that&amp;#39;s, it&amp;#39;s a bit dumb ig but, finding out about which afterlife theory is real. Finding the truth in that, what sucks is not being able to pass it down... I don&amp;#39;t have any belief of my own tho so I won&amp;#39;t bet (if I could) which would be real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I&amp;#39;m stuck and I suck at life. I&amp;#39;m a bit mental and quite literally alone (real life). I need some advice on where to go about this and whether or not I should die. I&amp;#39;m not confident in myself and feel like an alien/monster to even keep going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Some things that keep me going is art (any sorts really), gaming, going outside to the wooded and mountainous areas, fantasizing in things like space, science, and the sky. Writing scripts/making stories and watching new videos. Browsing the web and finding weird stuff. 
In general, distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By looking forward to the future I meant as in changes, primarily changes in lifestyle, as in getting more friends at that time and being better and changing things to be good. I don&amp;#39;t believe in everything should be good though. Mainly wanting a balance, bad things are great and nothing is black and white to me but grey. Lately been finding things to be too bad, obviously as to why.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know things can and will get more balanced out but honestly I don&amp;#39;t think I care anymore to see it and as the specs of dust we are in space. Don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s important too. I think I&amp;#39;m rather fine with missing out.&lt;/p&gt;

I wish I could just pick myself up and suck it up. But I can&amp;#39;t. I don&amp;#39;t know why, I know its irrational but I can&amp;#39;t do it. I&amp;#39;m useless. I can barely even write a fucking reddit post without having a panic attack.The one time I try to come in for my school&amp;#39;s consuelling, they&amp;#39;re all backed up. And the only time they&amp;#39;re open is when I have my classes, so whats the fucking point in trying anymore. Why do I even try? I&amp;#39;m literally the lowest I&amp;#39;ve ever been and everyone is too &amp;quot;busy&amp;quot; for me. It&amp;#39;s not like any of my &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; care either. I&amp;#39;m always conveniently left out of group plans because I&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;pleasant&amp;quot; to be around anymore. I&amp;#39;m so fucking alone and nobody could care less.&lt;/p&gt;

So i've been with this girl (yep its about a girl) for over 5 entire years , in which we loved eachother so much , i gave her my everything , my hopes , love , dreams , future , effort , she was my everything , and now that i lost her am nothing.

She broke up with me 2 months ago , am confused , one month before the break up she was planning on how she wants to marry me and then boom. But what really hurts is that She treated me like trash the few weeks before the break up and that she's totally erased me from her life after the break up , its as if i never happened , as if am a nobody , all that i gave her those 5 years and all the sacrifices i had to make for her just vanished , I KNOW there is no way she'll talk to me again , she's too stuborn and proud to do that , i swear guys i did nothing wrong , am not arrogant or anything but i was the best one could ever be with her.
Now am left all alone while she seems happy and already over me with her army of guy friends , it hurts so much , the jealousy kills me , i love her still , me on the other hand i have no one , and now girl friends , i had to push them all away for her , she was enough for me , i have a few friends (guys) but after a months of my nagging they got tired of it and i dont blame them for that. Usually am a logical person but i cant seem to apply any logic when it comes to her.

Am broken , and constantly in pain , both mentally and physically , my chest is so heavy and i cant function properly at anything , am doing bad in my job and in my studies , and am being down and toxic to the few ppl close to me , i cant sleep , and if i do , i dream of her smile and our good times and wake up sweaty and barely being able to breath as if it was a nightmare.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi there. If anyone reads all of what I've written here, I'll be amazed and very grateful. Thank you 

So, my head.. has been in a weird place lately, and summarizing everything that has happened to me lately and how I am doing is hard.

This is really the first time im writing any of this out, i haven't been able to access it. So it's messy and I'll probably repeat stuff.. sorry. I need help organizing my thoughts on the matter.

I am 19, im not working or in school right now. I was in community college last year but left bc couldnt focus in the online classes. Then my mom got worse and emotionally abusive to the point that i moved out and now live with a friend's family who took me in. The last two months I've been trying to adjust to living here, being away from my mom, that my mom was being abusive to me my whole life and i never knew, It's still so new that i can't process all of it.
I'm very grateful to the family for taking me in but don't know how I'm going to get through this. 

I was diagnosed with adhd this year but haven't recieved any working treatment for it and it has continued to severely impact my life and be disabiling. 

Also, I am autistic and fighting to be properly assessed and treated for that as well. How my neurodivergences affect me is integral to my recovery and no one seems to be able to help. I'm not close at all to getting a diagnosis, its crazy expensive, my mom doesn't think I need one, etc. I feel like my therapist isn't helping me anymore. I'm so emotionally burnt out. It's too intense to feel so it is shut off and numb. Everything..is numb. The world doesn't feel real, I don't feel real, and I can't seem to articulate any of this until right now and so my therapist has no idea how I'm REALLY doing even though she knows what's been going on. 

 I've struggled with my mental health since I was 14, but likely had anxiety as a child too. I am an only child with divorced parents and my mom recently kicked me out/i left and she demanded my key back

I'm scared. Of growing up, being alive, that I'm never going to get better, or have treatment that works for me, or my mom to love me and be accepting of me and not damaging

Just... so many things going on all at once. There's more too but those are the most important ones. I


I feel like I would kill myself if I understood more about it but I don't and don't have the energy to look. I have all of these thoughts that go everywhere all of the time and I don't know how to live like this. 

Im also worried about my dad and because he's already had one severe heart attack and he's almost 61 and i feel so bad for him hes working himself 6-7 days a week and looking older every time  i see him..

I don't see a way out, just navigating this blurry haze forever until something snaps and I kill myself. I don't like thinking about it to avoid making a plan but i think i am going to.

I have a lot of anxieties and a lot of thoughts and feelings that I need to process in therapy but it doesn't happen and I'm fighting for diagnosis and treatment for autism cause it affects everything in how i process emotions and think but because i was undiagnosed as a kid i struggled a lot beneath the surface and masked/camouflaged to fit in.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi. Throwaway for anonymity.

I’ve been out as trans for about four years now. When I came out, I just started college and my family threw me away. I kept going to college on federal loans, and I’m almost done. Somehow.

I’ve been on HRT for a little under 3 years now. It’s helped a little bit, don’t get me wrong. However, I still want to kill myself.

I’ve kind of wanted to kill myself my entire life. The only reason I made it to age 18 is because I kept telling myself “hey, it’ll get better once I transition. You’ll finally be yourself.”

Maybe in a sense, it has gotten better.

However, things are also fucking worse. I get fucking bullies and harassed on the street. Not because I’m pretty, but because men think it’s funny to treat me like a fetish that they throw away later. I haven’t made any real friends in college. I don’t party, but I’ve tried to join whatever organizations I can (who will accept me) and I have ended up with nothing. No one wants to be friends w me because I’m “too much work” because I’m trans.

Moreover, literally not a single has given me a chance at an internship. No professors like me because they think the trans thing is “gross” or “annoying”. I will be jobless and homeless at this rate.

,SuicideWatch,"I haven’t felt true happiness since I was about 12-ish. I am now 20, 21 will be approaching soon after New Years. 

My entire teenage years were caught up in a battle between my divorced parents, a battle within myself about my own identity and me wanting to die. 

I have lost contact with three very young siblings because I left my emotionally abusive fathers house at 18 and moved back to my mothers house. I lived solely with her and my other siblings up until I was 11. 

Both parents have there issues. I prefer living with my mother. But I do wish she would understand that depression and mental illness can be hereditary. The day to day living situation is much better for me in her house. She is not currently on anti depressants but she has in the past. My older brother has mental health issues too. 

I hate that it is still such a difficult thing to talk about. 

Every single day I battle with the fact that I am missing out on my younger siblings because of my father. Several attempts to communicate have been made my me. None ever replied to. 

Anytime I casually bring it up around my mother that I’m missing them, she just doesn’t care because they are his kids. It doesn’t click with her that I seriously miss them. 

Since being forced out of my fathers life, his mother (my grandmother) has been on my side whole heartedly. Because she chose my side, she is also missing out on my brothers and sisters lives. 

I also have two young brothers in my mothers house. I have older siblings but I honestly don’t care for them as I do all my younger siblings. The brothers in my mothers house love that I’m around now because when I lived with my father, he wouldn’t let me visit them.

All these issues and more leaves me feeling completely hopeless. Not just recently but for years. I always used to tell myself “ hang on til you turn 18” because I thought things would go so much easier when I inevitably moved out of my fathers house. 

Thoughts of suicide cross my mind at least once a day. Sometimes more. I also self harm. It started when I was 16, I stopped for a long time. Then earlier this year I did it again. 

My grandmother calls me every night. Sometimes we talk about my father. She believes that he has been manipulated by his new wife. But that is not the case. He’s a horrible person and she is just equally as horrible. 

When I think of ending things, I always remind myself that my siblings are so young. I desperately want to know them and build relationships with them. I don’t care if takes 5/10/20 years, I want to have those relationships. But then the suicidal thoughts come in and I feel like it will be so much easier to end it now than to suffer without them for that much longer.

Also my grandmother. She is getting older. She’s in her early 60’s, a cancer survivor and just a great person. If I killed my self it would kill her too. I feel obligated to not do it while she is still alive. And I know that when she does die, I will be so lost. 

I have never cried or spoken up to the people closest to me about my feelings. They would all 100% wish I spoke up if I died tomorrow, but if I spoke up and asked for help tomorrow that’s a different story.

Basically I feel that my life is in autopilot until I can build a relationship with my brothers and sister. And I hate feeling so helpless about the situation.

They respond “Meh,” like they can’t be bothered. It’s pure laziness and/or apathy. Why take a few minutes to chat with me when they can watch football? Priorities.

Or they have some pessimistic advice and want to tell me what I’m doing is “too hard” or that admissions are super competitive. Well, guess what? The things I ask for help/advice on are big parts of what matters to me in life. They’re passions. I didn’t get a fair chance growing up and going through school.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already asked people for help solving issues. These are easy things, like when I ask for advice as I apply to a school, which is one of the biggest issues in my life right now. They respond “Meh,” like they can’t be bothered. It’s pure laziness and/or apathy. Why take a few minutes to chat with me when they can watch football? Priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or they have some pessimistic advice and want to tell me what I’m doing is “too hard” or that admissions are super competitive. Well, guess what? The things I ask for help/advice on are big parts of what matters to me in life. They’re passions. I didn’t get a fair chance growing up and going through school. I decided that instead of giving up, I’d give myself a second chance. Just because you have given up on something doesn’t mean I must, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever. I tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one I ask cares. Maybe I can accept that.&lt;/p&gt;

I dont give a flying fuck If anyone tells me that I shouldn’t care and that other’s people opinion is not important. I can hear them talking about me everywhere, staring at me and judging me. This makes me insane and wondering if they know something about me that I don’t. 

I can’t even talk to people without sweating and shaking. I can’t look to other people’s eyes because I fucking hate when anyone’s looking at me. So I always look on the ground.

,SuicideWatch,"never made a reddit account, never will use this one again. i have nothing to go to anymore. this isn't going to change anything, and i can't help but read all of these other posts and think about how disconnected i am from them. there's a piece of me that breaks with each post about someone else struggling, but that part of me is so faint now that it feels like nothing. now i just see these posts and wonder why anyone will give a shit about mine if i can hardly pay attention to theirs. i feel disgusting. i feel cold. i feel selfish, and i realistically am. im a privileged piece of shit who isnt helping myself nearly as much as i could, but at the same time what else can i do? my depression and self hatred says it's all my fault, but is it really? years of undiagnosed chronic pain, suppressing feelings for years until i couldnt take it and broke down, holding it together because no one else fucking could, and all this shit just led to me being a mess of a human being that cant even be bothered to clean up regularly. every part of me is disgusting and i hate myself for it.

i dont even want to die. im too fucking afraid of the idea and i cant subject anyone to the same thing that a family member did some years back. i just want to fall asleep for a while. my dreams, however unrealistic and forgettable, are the only times where i feel a shred of decency now. i wake up and immediately remember that im a failure and a lazy piece of shit who should just open the laptop and fucking write their paper already. a piece of shit that fears death but cant help thinking about it. a piece of shit that actively searches for watchpeopledie content, not because it's entertaining, but because i need it to remind me why i can never go down that path. at the end of the day, i can never end up like those people. maybe i shouldnt be posting here, then.

but i fucking hate life, and im an asshole for it. i should be grateful. after a breakdown midway through high school i was lucky enough to take classes at a school that pretty much spoiled me. i was doing so much better and so excited for college. i got a free fucking ride to the college i chose to attend this fall. i dont even need to pay for room and board now because this entire year is virtual. shouldnt i be fucking thankful?

im not. i was so looking forward to getting out of this goddamn household with a sibling that practically built my childhood trauma. and now im stuck in my room nearly 24/7 doing schoolwork in dim lighting without the equipment i need. my room is suffocating and i have nowhere else to go. there are fights nearly daily that i have to hide from and listen to. sometimes they distract me from class or force me to ask my professor if i can stay muted until the yelling stops.

im a legal adult that feels like a permanent child. i feel like i'll never understand what to do with myself. i cannot get work done. i cannot love myself. i cannot trust anyone since my last best friend pulled a 180 on me and bullied me for the entirety of 9th grade. i hate myself and feel like im nothing but a burden to others. i cry the most when i hear from my friends, because part of me knows they care, but another part is sure that im the most forgettable of them all. im there. thats it. would they really notice if i drifted away from them? more realistically, would it really take that long for them to move on?

im sick of figuring out medications. i recently started ADD meds in an attempt to get work done, but they come at a cost of making me more anxious and tense. i have PTSD from a stupid fucking bus driver crashing into a guard rail nearly two years ago, and i now have tics that embarrass me and make me feel like a fucking joke. i cannot think about something embarrassing or anxiety-inducing without vocally screaming afterwards. everything hurts. i have migraines and back pain. the ADD meds gave me a lot of fun energy the first week, but ive gotten used to it and now it's pretty basic. i have more energy, but that just means my emotions come out through crying or anger rather than silent apathy.

posted this once on mos but i’m posting it here as well

i have gotten a lot better than i was at the beginning of the year and the majority of 2019. my depression was simply unbearable and around the earlier months of 2020 i tried to end it. i sat in my bathroom for about an hour contemplating what to do. i was contemplating just slitting my wrist but that fucking terrified me. i instead just decided to use pills. i don’t remember all the details but i remember it was later at night and i would have gone to bed soon so i figured sleeping pills were my best bet. i couldn’t find sleeping pills specifically but i found some allergy relief pills and figured that would work. i looked it up and it was possible to od on them so i figured why not. i took a fuck ton of pills, i don’t remember how many but i regretted it pretty soon after. i wasn’t sure i made the right decision and i was kind of scared to go to sleep. i made myself throw up most of the pills and i was starting to feel less terrible. i was and still am a strong believer that the universe will do what’s right. i’m not religious or anything but that’s just kind of my personal views. i figured i had done all i could and like i said it was later so i wasn’t going to bother my mom. i cant even imagine how she would feel if i woke her up telling her i tried to kill myself. i had done all i felt i could and figured if i was meant to survive this then i would. and i would rather die than see the disappointment oh my parents face, especially my dad. i was pretty terrified of what was going to happen but eventually i fell asleep. i never told either of my parents or any of my friends. i accidentally implied to one of my friends that i attempted and she got scared and i haven’t mentioned it since. she’s still not sure i don’t think. honestly i don’t intend on telling anyone cause why would i but i just felt so bad about keeping it inside that i figured i would just tell reddit cause it’s anonymous so why not. in the past few months my mental health has been much better. i’ve had a few relapses and a couple of depressive episodes but nothing too bad. i don’t even know if this really counts as a suicide attempt cause i was never caught or anything but no matter what it was, while after it happened i never really thought about it, in more recent months i think about it constantly. it sucks that i don’t really have anyone to talk to in my real life but i mean i’m not suicidal anymore so it’s fine ig. i wonder if things would have been better if i had succeeded but i know my family would have been devastated. however they’d probably be more devastated if they found out i was gay lol. this has gone on super long so i guess i’ll end it here but yeah. sry i just needed to get this off my chest. thanks to those of y’all who made it to the end i’m sorry i know this was long lol. on the plus side i’ve been sh free for about a week i think. i had a bad relapse but i’m fine for the moment lol.

,SuicideWatch,"ive brought up suicide to them countless times, deleted and blocked them and disappeared for days and whenever i come back they act like nothing happened - they dont ask if im okay, they dont tell me they care, they act like i dont exist until they are bored enough to talk

they tell me im not ugly but i know they think i am - they tell me they love me but they dont show it with their actions so they must be manipulating me 

anyone i tell about this tells me to get new friends but how am i supposed to do that when every single one of my friendships has gone the same way? people treat me like shit because im emotional and suicidal and ugly and clingy and have anger and attachment issues - no one has ever cared enough to show genuine platonic or romantic interest in me because of these reasons - i am a deadweight, i am toxic, i am a burden to everyone and especially myself and everyone ends up leaving or forgetting me

im lonely and im touch-starved and i want more than anything to be loved and to be able to feel mutual love. but i cant because im not good enough for anyone apparently and i cant talk to anyone unless im actually attracted to them too, so im a hypocrite for being mad at people for not wanting to be with ugly me. 

im more mad at the guy who lied to me over and over about being in love with me when he really wasnt and then left me and reappears every now and then as if nothing happened and tries to keep me on a string for whenever hes bored and horny. it hurts because i do love him or maybe im just sad and lonely and attaching myself onto any attractive person who shows me the slightest bit of attention. but i cant move on because he pops up every now and then to lie and tell me he misses me and then when i respond and try to talk to him he ignores me. ive deleted him before but i always end up adding him again and i cant move on because i want him and i cant make new friends because i dont have the mental energy to put into making new ones. 

i suck at talking to strangers - i hate everything - the moment i wake up i feel instant dread wondering “what am i going to do to pass the time until i pass out today” - “how am i going to stay distracted” - so i drink and drink, maybe cry  once it gets dark while everyone ignores and forgets me. 

i am so angry and i can never stop crying, i cant eat but it doesnt matter because ill never be pretty and skinny anyways - ii want to get skinnier and prettier in case the guy im in love with will ever want to be with me and i go to sleep with makeup on every night just in case he snapchats me - i want to hurt myself and i want to hurt everyone who ever pretended to love me just to leave me -

but im a fraud because im in my 20s and been suicidal since i was 12 but i have no legit attempts to my name - i always chicken out and dont have access to a gun which is the only method that doesnt scare me. im too pussy to slit my wrists open , when i used to cut i only did it to feel something not to die. i want attention - i want someone to want me but im too insecure to let someone love me even if they wanted to. 

i have no gas in my car so i cant drive to a bridge    and im also afraid of heights. maybe one day ill get drunk enough so im not afraid of anything. im so scared. i dont want to hurt anymore but i know its going to hurt on the way out. my life has been nothing but pain. i have never been truly happy. i feel like theres a demon in my brain that holds me back from anything good. 

im always tired but not tired enough to sleep when i should be. i have no reason to be alive and no one to talk to and i dont even really want to talk about it anymore. i want the world to hurt for letting me slip through the cracks even though i know its not the world’s fault it’s my mom’s fault for getting knocked up by an asshole who left an ugly crazy woman with an ugly insane daughter. it’s my fault for not killing myself sooner. i wish i had a gun. i hope i die before christmas - no one will care except my mom and everyone else will only pretend to care if they even find out. i dont care if mom cries. 

i want my face erased from the internet. i want it to be like i never existed. i never really did. no one ever really knew me and no one ever really cared. i hate this subreddit the way the positivity vigilantes pretend to care about anyone who wants to die. you dont care. you dont know us. stop lying about things getting better because they wont. some people genuinely have nothing to live for and living for another person is stupid. 

im tired of being in pain all the time and im tired of crying and im tired of caring about people who dont care about me. im tired of drinking and im tired of obsessing over food im not allowed to eat. im tired of living with my face and body.

&lt;p&gt;im always tired but not tired enough to sleep when i should be. i have no reason to be alive and no one to talk to and i dont even really want to talk about it anymore. i want the world to hurt for letting me slip through the cracks even though i know its not the world’s fault it’s my mom’s fault for getting knocked up by an asshole who left an ugly crazy woman with an ugly insane daughter. it’s my fault for not killing myself sooner. i wish i had a gun. i hope i die before christmas - no one will care except my mom and everyone else will only pretend to care if they even find out. i dont care if mom cries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i want my face erased from the internet. i want it to be like i never existed. i never really did. no one ever really knew me and no one ever really cared. i hate this subreddit the way the positivity vigilantes pretend to care about anyone who wants to die. you dont care. you dont know us. stop lying about things getting better because they wont. some people genuinely have nothing to live for and living for another person is stupid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im tired of being in pain all the time and im tired of crying and im tired of caring about people who dont care about me. im tired of drinking and im tired of obsessing over food im not allowed to eat. im tired of living with my face and body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im never going to get better unless i get thousands of dollars spent on plastic surgery. im just broken and unloveable. i hope i hurt someone someday the same way everyone hurt me&lt;/p&gt;

It was never true, and the only person I’ve truly loved has harmed me grievously, likely to the point of shortening my lifespan anyway. He has hurt my heart - literally.

I’m sitting here and it is just *thump thump thump thump*. Loud like drums in my ears and reverberating across my chest. For weeks and months and nearly two years now. I just want an escape. I beg for him to stop arguing but then I argue to try to get him to stop and now it’s my fault because somehow I’ve made him argue back even though the whole thing centered around me asking him not to argue. I argue that I matter and that my opinions deserve weight but that’s an argument too and he gets defensive and there is no end in sight. No comfort no love no peace. Just an endless circle of being torn down and told it will be okay, and starting to trust again only for there to be a giant hole in my chest for weeks afterwards. And all the while the expectation to be normal and the standard to not bring up the past or else he’ll be defensive again and suddenly I’m the one attacking him even though it’s him I fear, I’m the aggressor, because I’m starting it by asking for equality and safety. I could have just kept quiet. I could have.

“I just wanted a nice day.” That’s what he said this morning when I dared to talk about the arguments last night. You know, the ones where I needed safety and love and got anger and passive aggression. Yes, I was angry, because he hurt my heart, and who wouldn’t be angry, but when I’m angry I’m the one who needs to stop, he never had any duty not to harm me, what I’m angry about doesn’t matter, all that matters is now IM hurting HIM and I need to stop. He has no duty to stop physically harming me however. Now I’m abusive as I sit here slowly dying from my newfound heart problems begging him to stop hurting me. But it’s me. I’m a problem, the problem. I’m the one that fights because I want understanding and empathy and I won’t accept a relationship without that. But that’s fighting. Right there in the description. So now I’m the one fighting even though I say it all revolves around him fighting me. And my worthless opinions. If I could just be accepted... but no, I’m kidding myself, and that’s not truly attainable.

30 hours ago when my heart was quieter and I had hope I would heal. 30 hours when I lived in a fantasy land where I thought my best friend would keep his promise and stop arguing just for the sake of my health. Where I thought he might really, really listen, to my thoughts and my feelings for real — but even if I didn’t, surely he would not start an argument and let me be at peace just for my heart.

I don’t know how I got so stupid but I am. I don’t know I got so naive but I have. I am a shell of who I was many years ago and I’m unable this time to pick up the pieces. I am empty and I will have no one after I leave this apartment tomorrow. Not a home, not a hope, no more future. All my dreams slipping through my fingers. I’m too sick now.

I loved his family too. They don’t know about all the chest pain, though. They don’t know how much sleep I’ve lost or how much less like a human I feel. I don’t think they will miss me though I don’t blame them.
